There's that flower shop on Main
Lord, it's been too long since it's seen my face
I probably should've stopped by yesterday
Just a few miles from our house
There's a neon sign flashing "coldest beer in town"
Is she gone for good? Well, it's hard to say
But I'm going to be ready either way
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us
We'll either work it out or we won't
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't
I'm praying love will bring her back
Oh, just one more chance that's all I'll ever ask
I sure hope she ain't a memory yet
But she left her book there on the bed
Would a woman leave a man like that?
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me
Why did it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us
We'll either work it out or we won't
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't
Is she gone for good? Well it's hard to say
But I'm going to be ready either way
I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
One for every time I left her lonely waiting on me, baby
Why'd it take so long to see?
And this six pack might not be enough
But it's a damn good start if we're ending us
We'll either work it out or we won't
But I got a dozen roses if she comes back home
Yeah, I got these dozen roses in case she comes back home
And a six pack if she don't
And a six pack if she don't

I don't care that you done me wrong
Cause I've already moved on
I don't care what his name is
Girl, it is what it is
I won't waste a dime
Or the bartender's time
Trying to catch a buzz
Over the thought of us
But I'll drink to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'll raise my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
It don't matter what your friends say
They never liked me anyway
So if they see me drunk in this bar
It ain't over a broken heart
Cause I'm drinking to a country song
To another long work week gone
And I'm raising my glass to a long lost buddy I ain't seen
I might stay for one more round
Or I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey
Cheers to a good country song
To another long work week gone
And, yeah, I'm raising my glass to those savin' our ass overseas
I might stay for one more round
Hell, I might close this place down
But don't think for a second I'm out to drown your memory
No, don't think for one second I'm out to drown your memory
Girl, you ain't worth the whiskey, no
Baby, you ain't worth the whiskey

Come on
Woah

Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, up in your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Woah

I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
Yeah, with your beer in the headlights
Yeah girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
Woah
Girl you got my days and my mind mixed up
Last night we were on fire
Now I'm laying here wishing it is what it was
And thinking love is a liar
The way you dance in and out of my hands
Ain't nothing I can do but hold you when I can
You're like a boomerang
You like leading me on then you leave me alone
Aw, baby why, why you like a boomerang
Flying out of my arms off into the dark
Then you back again, like a damn boomerang
Every time I wonder where you are now
I get to looking out the window
Knowing you know right where I can be found
And how to keep me from letting go
It's hard to get you out of my head
With your every now and then, crashing in my bed
Like a boomerang
You like leading me on then you leave me alone
Aw, baby why, why you like a boomerang
Flying out of my arms off into the dark
Then you back again, like a damn boomerang
You're like a boomerang
You're cold, you're hot, you here then you not
Here you come now
Like a boomerang
I can't lock the door cause I can't wait for more
Give me some more
Boomerang
You like leading me on then you leave me alone
Aw, baby why, why you like a boomerang
Flying out of my arms off into the dark
Then you're back again, like a damn boomerang
Yeah you're way to good at this game
Aw, there you go, but I know you'll be back, you little boomerang
Here you come again

Old school McGraw coming out of my doors
Had to pull over, couldn't take it no more
Got this thing running in park, hazards lighting up the dark
I was just out driving around
Wasn't scanning for a memory to slow me down
But damn, if yours didn't baby
I'd'a paid that DJ not to play it

Cause I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time

People slowing down, wanna see what's wrong
I got my hand out the window just waving 'em on
Cause I don't wanna have to explain
Don't want no one to see me this way
Don't need no gas, don't need no ride
Everything on this Chevy is running just right
I just need another minute or two
'Til this song's over like me and you

I'm sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
It ain't a bar, it ain't the beer, it ain't the whiskey
I'd give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
Yeah, anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, said it is what it is
But I'm off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Yeah, baby, I'm broke down and it ain't the truck this time

Yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
Woulda done moved on, but I'm here like this
Off on the shoulder in a mess, all wrecked inside
Yeah, baby, I'm broke down, but it ain't the truck this time
No, it ain't the truck this time

I got nowhere go, nowhere to be
I'm nobody, baby, if you don't love me
There's a sun set setting on another good night
Little can't wait, tailgate party on ice
Chilling in the back of a four-wheel drive
'Bout to pop a top, mama let it rock
Some are gonna wanna fight, some are gonna wanna dance
Some are gonna wanna carry 'round one in each hand
Yeah, we all have a 'get a little crazy' plan
That we break out when we go out
Everybody's working out, doing twelve ounce curls
Boys buzzing, hung up on the country girls
Fishing for the line that'll kick her heart into gear
Hey brother, need another over here
Got the Kid Rock good time playlist on
All the worries in the world, they 'bout to be gone
Some drunk dude's in the crowd yelling
"Let's get weird, y'all"
Brought to you by a beer
That's right
It's all brought to you by a beer
A little hungover headache, sun coming up
Got her number, no name, can't remember what it was
If you can't find your wallet or your phone or your truck
Must have done it good, talking real good
Yeah you're hurting now, dragging 'round, moving slow
But at least you got the stories and pizza on the stove
Left over and only to eight hours to go
'Til it's back on, tie one off
Everybody's working out, doing twelve ounce curls
Boys buzzing, hung up on the country girls
Fishing for the line that'll kick her heart into gear
Hey brother, need another over here
Got the Kid Rock good time playlist on
All the worries in the world, they 'bout to be gone
Some drunk dude's in the crowd yelling
"Let's get weird, y'all"
Brought to you by a beer
Yeah, I think I'm gonna need another one
Everybody's working out, doing twelve ounce curls
Boys buzzing, hung up on the country girls
Fishing for the line that'll kick her heart into gear
Hey brother, need another over here
Got the Kid Rock good time playlist on
All the worries in the world, well, they gone
Some drunk dude's in the crowd yelling
"Let's get weird, y'all"
Brought to you by a beer
It's all brought to you by a beer
Yes it's all brought to you by a beer
Oh this right here, y'all
It's all brought to you by a beer
It'll get your head hurting in the morning light
It'll get you hungover, it'll get you back right
Hell, you might even have yourself a chance tonight
That's right
Well, with a little help of course
Aw yeah

The volume knob
It's a little tricky
Sometimes, it gets a little sticky
From your lip gloss
I'd like to rub off
Your pretty pink painted fingertips
1 and 2 are preset to country
3 and 4, well, that gets it bumpin'
We got some Willie
We got some Nelly
Find you one you like, girl
And give it a spin
And play it again

With your ray ban sunglasses
And my Braves hat
Turned backwards
Got you winkin' at me
Baby, it's your show
I'm drivers side
VIP, a front row
Keep turnin' it up
And turnin' me on
You're a rock star girl
I'm singin' along
It's like you know what you're doing to me
Every time you press play
Yeah, you've got me fallin' in love
My little Chevrolet DJ

Nights like these
Are made off the highway
Stealin' kisses as another song fades
Wakin' up
Callin' you up tomorrow
Sayin', baby, hit replay
I'm already missin' your face

With your ray ban sunglasses
And my Braves hat
Turned backwards
Got you winkin' at me
Baby, it's your show
I'm drivers side
VIP, a front row
Keep turnin' it up
And turnin' me on
You're a rock star girl
I'm singin' along
It's like you know what you're doing to me
Every time you press play
Yeah, you've got me fallin' in love
My little Chevrolet DJ

Uh huh, keep me fallin', girl
Every time you press play

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby

Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where I wanna be

I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it

Yeah I love rockin' with you and girl
We're just chillin' it
Girl, I bet your smile puts that ole Georgia moon to shame
Yeah, you got those eyes that make them stars scared to do their thing
So sexy in that dress wind blowing through your hair
Going to make me a mess in the middle of no where
Girl, I bet your dangerous after dark
That sun goes down lights a little spark
A little time to kill and a place to park
And I bet your dangerous dangerous
Sing along to the radio
Reeling me in like you don't know
Your kiss about to tear me apart
I bet your dangerous so dangerous after dark
I bet you got that side that little bit of wild no body gets to see
I'm thinking tonight we throw a little gas on that fire and you let it loose on me
The whiskey on your lips
A little reckless on your face come on give me a sip just a little taste
Girl, I bet your dangerous after dark
That sun goes down lights a little spark
A little time to kill and a place to park
And I bet your dangerous dangerous
Sing along to the radio
Reeling me in like you don't know
Your kiss about to tear me apart
I bet your dangerous so dangerous after dark
Straight through that caution line
Pedal to the floor
Oh, sweet child of mine
Turn it up a little more 

Girl, I bet your dangerous after dark
That sun goes down lights a little spark
A little time to kill and a place to park
Oh, I bet your dangerous dangerous
Sing along to the radio
Reeling me in like you don't know
Your kiss about to tear me apart
I bet your dangerous so dangerous after dark
Yeah, I bet your dangerous
So dangerous after dark
Yeah

Alright, alright, it's just a girl, just go say, "Hey."
Don't try any stupid lines
Seen you walk in about a quarter to ten
Even the jukebox starin' at you
Wonderin' what you wanna hear
Every bar stool sayin'
Honey, over here
Every fellow tryin' to buy you a beer
That denim how'd you get em on
Back pocket cell phone
Wish I had my number in it
Then, I could give you a call
And we could talk
If I could find the words
But first things first
Tell me, tell me
Does it hurt
Every time you walk in a room
Does it feel like work
Keepin' them country boys off of you
Are you tired of runnin'
Through my mind's
Poor boy neighborhood
All, tell me does it hurt
All, lookin' that good
I mean, I, I, I don't know what it's like to be that hot
Uh, so...
What's a pretty girl like you
Doin' in a place like this
All, that ain't no pick up line
But this is
Hit or miss
I can't quit, girl
Look at me lookin' at you
Lookin' like this
Does it hurt
Every time you walk in a room
Does it feel like work
Keepin' them country boys off of you
Are you tired of runnin'
Through my mind's
Poor boy neighborhood
All, tell me does it hurt
Yeah, lookin' that good
All, come on
Maybe, I should just get to know you a little better
You know? That's, that's probably what I should do
What do you, uh?
So, what do you do?
Are you a photographer?
I know you could picture me and you together, right?
No?
Well, maybe interior decorator?
This bar just became... beautiful?
Tell me, tell me
Does it hurt
Every time you walk in a room
Does it feel like work
Keepin' them country boys off of you
And how'd it feel
To fall from heaven
Would've kept you if they could
So, tell me does it hurt
Girl, lookin' that good
So where you, uh, where you from?
Denver, I just...
I'm sorry, I just asked you that
I uh, I uh...
Sunshine state, I love it
Yeah, I'm actually, uh, I'm from Nashville
I may end up havin' to take you back with me because
You're the only ten I see in here
You know what I'm... You know what I'm sayin?
No?
I'm just serious
You get it?
Or?
I mean maybe we could...
You wanna dance, or?
I don't either, it's gettin' late
Yeah...
I was actually about to leave myself
If there's a full moon hanging high
You can bet there's a jacked up four wheel drive
Cruising with the crew with a beer on ice
Looking for the girls that'll let their hair down
Lead us on, get us thinking they might
Share a little sugar on a Friday night
Making midnight memories lighting up the sky
In the country side we turn it up loud
Down here we keep the good times flowing
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it
Yeah, me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys
We're tighter than the tops we twist off
When the sun goes down and the work day's gone
Like something straight out of a country song
Raised up all farm tan tough
With the scuffs all over our boots
Little rough tangled up in our roots
Yeah, we got a little soft side too
When the girls get us all wrapped up
Down here we keep the good times flowing
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it
Yeah, me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up
Like me and my down home boys
Down here we keep the good times flowing
Red dirt flying, and the radio going
We got each other's back and everybody knows it
Yeah, me and my down home boys
Know how to show a town what's up
We pass it around then fill it back up
Ain't nobody gonna live this life up

No, ain't nothing ever gonna come between us
Me and my down home boys
Yeah
Yeah me and these down home boys

Smile beatin' my chest up, you're downright dangerous
That shake in your giddy up got my eyes going what what

Sippin' on this 7-7, never been this close to heaven
Got her pretty turned up to 11
Droppin' 'em dead on the dance floor
Somebody better call a doctor

I'm talkin' breaker breaker one niner
She's a flatliner
Oh, she's a flatliner

Dang, girl, I'm done, I ain't never seen no one
Poppin' it like a cold one and drop it down like uh huh
Oh my, see the light, I don't mean the neon kind
One kiss from you tonight and send me on to the other side

Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
You're the prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah, gotta get me some of that

Little more what you doin' right there
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy now girl I swear
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now just keep makin' this my favorite song

In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah, girl you got a way of

Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights

Swinging your hips, swinging your hair, girl
You know, I gotta get me some of that
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor
I want it now and later
The dam broke in her blue eyes
When that goodbye
Slipped off of my tongue
I said, "Girl, you gonna be fine"
"In no time, you'll be moving on"
I didn't think it'd be this fast
But looking through the plate glass
Of this bar
She's up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
Boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
Yeah, I was wanting these new wings
So I could do things
Anything that I want
Thought I was gonna fly high
Turns out I couldn't be more wrong
I think I got a broken pair
Cause I should be up there
Where she is
Yeah, way up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me shakin' my head, good god man
I must have been blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
No signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
This ain't what I had in mind
This heart full of regret
Forever left behind
With this picture in my head
Of her up on stage, singing with a frat band
Shoes in her left, beer in her right hand
Got me wishing that I was that mic stand
Man, I was so blind
She got her friends and her free bird face on
The boys buzzin, got 'em getting their chase on
And no signs of her putting them brakes on
And no doubt in my mind
That she's just getting rockin'
And I'm gettin' forgotten tonight
That's right
And she's up there rocking
And I'm getting forgotten tonight

Boot flask full of Jack
Nobody'd look, nobody'd ask
Holding out on a 10 o'clock 12-pack
Win or lose, it didn't matter
Cause soon as those jerseys hit the field
You know that's when it got real
With the rivalries and ride-with-mes
And let-me-know-where-you're-gonna-be's

At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game

T8 still on her cheek
Party in a field, she danced with me
That pull you close, bottled up all week
Win or lose, it didn't matter

At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game

We had those bragging rights to all those Friday nights
The stadium lights, those stadium lights

At the home game, we'd rock
That small town fame in the parking lot
All the pretty girls yelling "Go Big Blue"
Best part never made the front page news
It was under the bleachers
Cigarette stain on my lips from Cowboy Red
And her kiss and all of it, all of it, yeah
Gone in a flash, the times that we had
Got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
It's just what we did and now nothing's changed
They're still falling in love at the home game
Yeah, they're still falling in love at the home game

I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss
Baby taste the moonshinin' off of your lips
I want to see that 'want ya' smile
Still got me hooked, been hooked for awhile
If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet
And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed
If you got some room for a little regret
Let me know girl I've already left...

If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up
I, hope you get lonely tonight
We ain't gotta make up, just kiss me
We could straight up blame it on the whiskey
You ain't gotta wake up and miss me, no
I hope you get lonely tonight

I don't care if you're spinnin' in the neon
Or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on
Either way the thought is turning me on
And I can't shake it girl I'm wide awake, so


Hope you get lonely
Hope you get lonely
Hope you get lonely tonight
Girl

Lonely tonight
Lonely tonight
Yep girl, I hope you get lonely tonight
Here we go y'all
It's going down tonight
Me and the boys, headed down to the club
Rolling 5 deep, all packed in the truck
Kicking up dust, we 'bout to bust through the door
They ain't ever seen nothing like us before
But they about to
Who's with me, how about you
Yeah
It's about to get
Hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
Talking girls pouring the shots
Boys spilling their beer
Everybody dancing with their hands up
The DJ playing what you wanna hear
If you rocking the smoke, rocking the drink
If you ain't gonna stop, then you rolling with me
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when we wake up
Getting right tonight before it disappears
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
It's about to get hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here
No, we ain't the only ones came here with a plan
The hot girl in the corner's got four hot friends
A couple 10-10's, gather down and we're in
So it's a win-win, cause we 'bout to get bent
In a good way, looks like we found the right place
Hey

Hoppin' in here, hoppin' in here

Boys spilling their beer

Hoppin' in here, oh yeah
Everybody, everybody got their hands up
It's a party tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow when we wake up
Ha ha

When I've been gone, when I'm right here
The minute my eyes open in the morning
Out on some highway, or pulling in the driveway
Clear blue sky or when it's thunder storming
My mind just can't escape you
The first time I touched you, that's when I knew

I want you trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, girl I just want you

When you get rattled, or you're coming all unraveled
When your holding everything together for me
The way you revealed me, the way that you feel me
The way you know I'm holding something inside
Don't know what time has for us
But as long as I'm here, one thing I'm sure of

I want you trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you

Yeah, I just want you

I want you trust me, I want you to love me
I want you to need me like I'm something you can't lose
I want you to save me, I want you to crave me
Even when I can't find my way to you
If you ever once doubt, anything I'm about
All it ever comes down to, is girl I just want you

Yes, I do
I just want you

Baby it was just one night
One kinda just like this
Maybe it was just one song
But one I won't ever forget
And maybe it was just one dance
Out on the beach bar floor
I had you there in my hands
But let you slip out that door

And girl I don't even know how to act now
You can put all them other girls in the background
I can only picture you
A couple seconds felt more like an hour or two
And I was all right, thought I was on to the next one
I don't know why I can't forget one
Little taste of your lips
Well come on baby, tell me, tell me what you put in that kiss
That got me all tore up like this
A little summertime tease with a twist
Never knew how much I'd miss, that kiss

And that pretty little small town smile
That you put right there on mine
Now I ain't got your number to dial
Or I'd be callin' you every night
Yeah your friends came runnin' up
And you told me that you had to leave
Girl you left me here with half a beer
In the middle of a memory
Woah-oh-oh

Spinning around spilling their beer

What you say you leave your friends with mine?
Oooh, ooh, yeah, they'll be alright
Ooh, I just wanna see you shine
Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl
Whatcha think about taking that chance
Taking a ride, taking my hand
Kicking this crowd, ditching this club?
This night's been waiting on us
Ooh, ooh, save your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'til I get us where we're getting to
Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
I can see you getting my tailgate rocking
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hopping
Bring the beat back
Aw, come on with me girl
Yeah, you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl
Come on come on come on, let me see you girl
Girl I swear
I get scared looking in your eyes
Start thinking about where I'd be now
If I wasn't with you tonight
I've done a lot of crazy things
But you saved me and you reeled me in
There ain't no doubt
I'd take us right now
Over me back when
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way
Making my way to you
Yeah, Making my way
Making my way to you
Now I know why all those
Wrong ones didn't work out
It's easy to see
But hard to believe
That I got my arms around
My forever, I coulda never
Dreamed it up this good
Ain't it funny how
Things work out
Better than you
Thought they would
Back when a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way to you
I didn't know what
I was looking for
No, I didn't have a clue
Next thing I know
I'm thanking the lord
For everything I went through
Making my way
Making my way to you
While I was
Makng my way
Making my way to you, yeah
A lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face
Now baby I'm holding on
To what I never wanna lose
I took a few wrong turns
Down a couple back roads
But wound up where
I was supposed to
Making my way
Making my way to you
Baby, I've been
Making my way
Making my way to you
Yeah, a lot of beer got drank
A lot of hell got raised
A lot of nights got long
But that was long
Before I saw your face

Baby, it just took one look at you
For me to change my one drink order to two
Like we already knew each other
Like we've been talking all night
About a minute into our first dance
We got blindsided by your friends
All in a hurry like you had to go
Didn't they know you can't leave someone
Girl, you can't leave someone

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?

We were gonna dance 'till they shut it down
People'd be staring while I spin you 'round
Thinking we were so in love, yeah
They wouldn't know we hadn't even hooked up
I'd get your number and I'd give you mine
And we'd be hanging out tomorrow night
But now I don't know where you are
I'm under these lights right here in the dark

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of an old school country song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
Girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me in the middle of a memory? yeah

Yeah, it's like you walked right out in the middle of a movie
Tore the back half out of a book
And no, you'll never know, girl, what you did to me
It ain't right saying goodbye

In the middle of a dance floor all alone
In the middle of what could've been our song
Right when I was just about to lean on in
Why'd you have to go then?
Baby, in the middle of the glow of the neon light
It shoulda, coulda, woulda been the night of our lives
But, girl, it ain't right, no
How you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory?
In the middle of a memory
In the middle of a memory
Raise em up high
If you're with me tonight
It's no can left behind
Let me lay it
All out on the table
If you're here then
You're willing and able
To let go of that long week
And get a little weekend
Carried away
How 'bout a 12-pack packed
Just between us
We're gonna drink 'em all gone
Y'all, this is some serious stuff
As far as I can tell
They can't consume themselves
So let's throw
A little help their way
Raise em up high
If you're with me tonight
We're on a cold case mission
I got your back if you got mine
To hell with our problems
Yeah, we 'bout to solve 'em
With every single ounce we got
That's right it's no can
No can left behind
It might take us all night long
And a whole bunch of country songs
But everything hang in there
Till our work around here's through
Y'all know what to do
I'll be right back
Hey, hey good looking
What'd you come here for
Oh you ain't just thirsty
Well, tell me more
I knew it, it's your ex
Yeah, I've had a few
So this cold one's for you
Raise em up high
If you're with me tonight
We're on a cold case mission
I got your back if you got mine
Yeah, to hell with our problems
Yeah, we 'bout to solve 'em
With every single ounce we got
That's right it's no can
No can left behind
Aw, solo
It's all in here
Hopefully not gonna
Have to roll outta here tonight
Watch this
With a little team working
We can put a little hurting
On everything cold and light
All in favor say I
It's no can, no can left
I said no can
Yeah, everybody's helped
Till there's no can
No can left behind
Alright
I thought it was
A pretty good plan y'all
The beer's not gonna drink itself
So uh, there's a couple left
There's one for me
I'll just keep that one cold
I don't trust ya to drink it all

I rode around long enough
With my windows down
Let that breeze roll in, carry your perfume out
I took your number and messages off my phone
Oh, but you ain't gone

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

It's like your memory, has got a map of my mind
No matter where I go, you find me every time
Alone or in a crowd, I hear you whispering baby
It's driving me crazy

Wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head

Damn, you're hard to forget
Oh, oh

Yeah, wish I could close my eyes and not have to see you smiling
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
You're dancing all around it, girl, you got me surrounded
Yeah, yeah, can't get you outta my head
I got you off of these walls, I got you outta my bed
But girl I'm no better off, can't get you outta my head
You're nowhere close to being gone outta my head
Mmm, outta my head

You ain't gone
Outta my head
Girl, outta my head
Oh, you ain't gone

There she was, little blue jean buzz
Just bare footing around
I said, "What's up?" She hopped in the truck
And we were right away running the town

She's the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
And everything dark just lights up
But all summers end, now she's gone with the wind
And the reason I spend so many nights up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party wa-wa-wasn't over

I still hear her laughing like it just happened
Like I was just with her here
Well, she had the magic and I had the habit
But then she just disappeared

See, I'm the kinda guy that just can't get her off my mind
No matter how hard I try, she's all I think of
Another lesson learned, but hey, the world still turns
So I guess it's time to turn another drink up

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over

These days, I can't even hear a wave crash
And I get carried away and go George Strait back
To a slow dance out in the sand
When the keg was still cold and she was holding my hand

Somebody, somebody shoulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over
Hands up in the air, still swaying
That band she loves still playing
She had this old boy from the boondocks
Sweet talking, walking on moon rocks
I wish somebody woulda told her
This party, this party wasn't over

No, it wasn't over
Yeah, this party, this party, this party wasn't over
Hands still swaying, band still playing
Damn, this party wasn't over
This party, this party, this party wasn't over
This party, this party, this party wasn't over

Remember, boys, never let a lady open the door
And be there with a lighter if she wants a smoke
Remember, boys, never let her go to sleep crying
When she tells you 'bout her dreams
You gotta fill 'em up with hope

Cause I don't wanna be a one night boy
I don't wanna be an ain't right boy
I don't wanna be a , wait it out, no call kinda love song boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys

Remember, boys, always open her beer first
And tell her that you love her even when she makes you mad
And remember, boys, no matter what, you make it work
You want her and need her and fight to keep her
Let her know you know what you have

I don't wanna be a one night boy
I don't wanna be an ain't right boy
I don't wanna be a , wait it out, no call kinda love song boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys

No, I don't wanna be a late night boy
I don't wanna be a heartbreak boy
I don't wanna be a can't trust him with your love kind of loser boy
I don't wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
I don't wanna be a June to September
I wanna be one of those remember boys
That's right
I wanna be one of those remember boys

She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

We spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

And the rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

We spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her, yeah

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
Like an old beach roller coaster

Ice meltin' down in another strong drink
Takin' my time, sipping through the pain alone, all alone
Gettin' on up and gettin' out of this place
Ain't worth the chance of me seeing your face again, not with him
It's kinda like ending up in hell with nobody to blame but yourself

I should've ran after you
I should've known everything I had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you

If I'da spent another minute staring in your eyes
Maybe I'da seen how lonely I would be, now look at me
I should've been lovin' your tears away
Instead of standing there with nothing to say at all
Yeah, girl the second I saw tail lights...

I should've ran after you
I should've known everything I had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you

Yeah, one second thought, I could have stopped it all
Letting you go was just the calm before the storm
I'd threw myself in to
I should've ran after you
Girl, I should've thought it through

I should've ran after you
And you're the hardest thing I ever had to lose
Yeah, before you walked away and let me have my space
Before I ran you right in to the arms of someone new
I should've ran after you

Yeah, I should've ran after you
Yeah, I should've
Now I've got ice meltin' down in another strong drink
Taking my time, sippin' through the pain

Don't sound like me
It's hard to believe
Only been three weeks
And my worlds spinnin' round a girl
The prettiest thing I ever saw
I've stood all
I can stand
Of bitin' my tongue
Holdin' it in
Along with that long blonde hair
You're makin' me fall

This beer in my hand is just enough courage
To say what I'm feeling
Cause you got me all nervous
Just like you do every time
You're lookin' like that
I freeze up and
I take another sip
Lean in a little closer like this
What you got me sayin'
I ain't blamin' on a buzz tonight
Cause these ain't six pack lines
Oh, these ain't six pack lines

This is comin' from the heart
Here in the dark
My trucks in park
But my minds going 95
And I even thinkin' bout slowin' it down
No, but whatever you want
We can take our time
Whatever it takes
To make you mine
Girl, it ain't even midnight yet
And the secrets out

This beer in my hand is just enough courage
To say what I'm feeling
Cause you got me all nervous
Just like you do every time
You're lookin' like that
I freeze up and
I take another sip
Lean in a little closer like this
What you got me sayin'
I ain't blamin' on a buzz tonight
Cause these ain't six pack lines
Oh, these ain't six pack lines
This ain't no
Say one thing in the moonlight
Then, take it all back with the sunrise
Baby, just as sure as those stars shine
I wanna be there
To kiss you goodnight

This beer in my hand is just enough courage
To say what I'm feeling
Cause you got me all nervous
Just like you do every time
You're lookin' like that
I freeze up and
I take another sip
Lean in a little closer like this
What you got me sayin'
I ain't blamin' on a buzz tonight
Cause these ain't six pack lines
Oh, these ain't six pack lines
These ain't six pack lines
Girl, you got me buzzin' on you tonight
These ain't six pack lines
Don't know what you're doin'
But you're doin' it right
No, these ain't six pack lines

You wish on 'em, party underneath 'em
Way out there where it's easy to see 'em, stars
Yeah, if they line up, tonight you're gonna
Thank your lucky ones for shining down on you, stars

You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars

You stare at 'em, swear if you could reach 'em
You'd give her one 'cause she's got you seeing the stars
Since that night she stole your heart

You stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars

She fell from 'em so you point your prayers at 'em
Cause she's got you feeling about as high as 'em

Since you stopped and filled up
With a red and black one at the Texaco
She hopped in your truck
Sang along with one on the radio
Big red one going down
Feel like one in a small town
Parked way out in the dark
And they danced on the hood
She was sitting on the shining light
Then gave you that look
They were in her eyes, she couldn't hide 'em
By the end of the night, you were falling just like stars
Stars

When I feel my phone buzzing, ain't even gotta look down
I know it's you that's calling, a couple drinks in by now
So I say, "Hello," you say, "Hey, babe"
Say you're 'bout to catch a cab over to my place
"See you in five," but, baby, this time

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown

Ain't gonna lie, if you knock on my door
I'm gonna let you walk in
Let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
But you know in the morning
We're gonna regret everything we did
So why even start what ain't good for our hearts

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown

Keep sipping your drink, keep spinning the room
Keep chasing the night like you always do
Keep letting the good times play
Don't let me get in your way

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Stay downtown
Yeah, this time around, baby, stay downtown
Well, they call 'em the cheap seats
Yeah right, fifty bucks a piece
It's pretty steep for a guy like me
But it's worth it baby just to see your eyes
Light up tonight 
We can barely even see the band
Out here by the beer stand, oh but you don't care
You take my hand, say you wanna dance and we're
Swaying, and praying
That the band don't ever stop playing
Our favorite songs all night long
Oh baby, don't it feel so right?
Me rocking you side to side
Just staying in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swaying
They say the show's sold out
And it's one of their biggest crowds
But all I see is two people right now
Just me and you and all I wanna do
Is never leave this place
With these arms around your waist
Take a little break for a kiss, on your lips
Been waiting to long for a night like this just
Swaying, and praying
That the band don't ever stop playing
Our favorite songs all night long
Oh baby, don't it feel so right?
Me rocking you side to side
Just staying in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swaying
I just wanna be close to you
And baby all I wanna do, is keep
Swaying, and praying

Our favorite songs all night long
Oh baby, don't it feel so right?
Me rocking you side to side
Just staying in these arms of mine
Wrapped up tight just swaying
Oh girl, just praying
You'll stay in these arms all night
Well they call em the cheap seats, yeah right fifty bucks a piece. It's pretty steep for a guy like me but it's worth it baby, just to see your eyes light up tonight . We can barely even see the band out here by the beer stand. Oh but you don't care, you take my hand, say you wanna dance and we're

Moon coming through the pines
Cranking up a country song
Heaven right by your side
And a Saturday night barely hanging on
Sun shining through the stained glass
Humming "Just As I Am"
I'm praying that feeling would last
That feeling that saves you
Makes you wanna raise your hands
That's the way it was
And that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and the buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
I had my first taste of beer
My first taste of a broken heart
There were good times, there were tears
But every red dirt memory left a mark
Like the words written there in red
Like the streets that are made of gold
Where we always bowed our heads, where mama saved our seats
And Jesus saved our souls
That's the way it was
And that's the way it is when you're growing
Up in the mud and the buck the way we did
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
It got me where I am and where I'm gonna go
We learned all about believing
And everything we were ever gonna need to know
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
Somewhere between the back roads and the back row
Yeah yeah, somewhere out there between the back roads and the back row
I knew when the seatbelt come undone
And I knew when you would flip the console up
And move my daddy's gun
I knew when the road turned to dirt
The way you were in the clear
You went to pullin' on my shirt
Poppin' buttons in my beer
You're like a wild fire
In a runaway wind
I'm just a silverado cowboy
Who tryin' to rope you in
When you're lookin' that way
It ain't much left to say
So baby do your thing
The way you're lookin' in my eyes
With your hair falling down
Way out here high on this hill
With the lights off and the back drop of our little town
Baby it ain't no way I'm ever coming down
From the way you're loving me now
The way you're loving me now
Like you've been caged up for a long, long time
Like you've saving it all up
For a night like tonight
And I'm just the lucky one
To have you come all undone
Kissing me, loving me
Lay it all up on me girl
The way you're lookin' in my eyes
With your hair falling down
Way out here high on this hill
With the lights off and the back drop of our little town
Baby it ain't no way I'm ever coming down
From the way you're loving me now
Baby there ain't no way, no how
I'm never gonna slow you down
From the way you're loving me now
Yeah
The way you're lookin' in my eyes
With your hair falling down
Way out here high on this hill
With the lights off and the back drop of our little town
Baby it ain't no way I'm ever coming down
From the way you're loving me now
I love the way you're loving me now
The way you're loving me now

Aw, this is how the downtown crew rolls down here
Aw yeah

The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at

This is how we roll...
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah...
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll...

Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though
Let's roll!

This is how we roll...
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah...
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll...
Just roll
Yeah, roll with us anytime

We're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
We cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day

This is how we roll...
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio, woah....
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slangin' up the mud cuttin' through the country side, baby
This is how we roll...

Yeah, yeah this is how we roll
You know, you know
This how we roll
This is how we do
We burnin down the night shootin bullets at the moon
Baby this is how we roll 
Yeah this is how we roll 

You're up on your high heels, you're up on the bar
You're up on a level, up there with the shooting stars
Dancing around the drinks with honkey tonk angel wings
Making the party sing, yeah, that's my baby
It ain't even midnight yet, there's a whole lot of neon left
Looks like we're gonna get all kinds of crazy

We'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me up

You're up on the tailgate, you're up on a 3 beer buzz
You're up like the music pumping out of the cab of my truck
Up where the city lights can't help but get, get outshined
By the blue jeans and brown eyes I pull in closer
Yeah, this night's far from over with

Still up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me
Up on a high like I'm walking on clouds
Baby, tonight I don't wanna come down

You'll be up like the sun in the New Jersey sky
Up like the wheels on a Bahama flight
Twisting that bottle, tipping that cup
Girl, the way you rock me, you know that you got me
Up on a high like I'm walking on clouds
Baby, tonight I don't wanna come down
I don't wanna come down

We don't need a Friday
We don't need a crowded bar downtown
To get a little sideways
Yeah, we got our own way to get unwound
Every now and then
Everybody knows
You gotta live a little
Let your crazy show
When the world gets to spinnin' too fast
And you wanna make it stop
We got the spot

This is our night
This is our time
Gettin' out of sight
And out of our minds
Cold beer bringin' out the wild side
Out here livin' up the wildlife
We toast the sky with everyone we know
Here's to us and just lettin' it go
Howlin' at the moon hangin' up high
Feelin' just right
Out here livin' up the wildlife
Yeah, out here livin' up the wildlife

A little static on the radio
With some seven eleven
Nights down in the cooler
That's all she wrote
We gettin' down in the dust
No, they can't tame us

This is our night
This is our time
Gettin' out of sight
And out of our minds
Cold beer bringin' out the wild side
Out here livin' up the wildlife
We toast the sky with everyone we know
Here's to us and just lettin' it go
Howlin' at the moon hangin' up high
Feelin' just right
Out here livin' up the wildlife
Yeah, we just livin' it up

Every now and then
Everybody knows
You gotta live a little
Let your crazy show
When the world gets to spinnin' too fast
And you wanna make it stop

This is our night
This is our time
Gettin' out of sight
And out of our minds
Cold beer bringin' out the wild side
Out here livin' up the wildlife
Yeah, we toast the sky with everyone we know
Here's to us and just lettin' it go
Howlin' at the moon hangin' up high
We feelin' just right
Out here livin' up the wildlife
Yeah, I'm talkin' bout the wildlife

Everybody raise them up
We're livin' the wildlife tonight
It's the way that you move when a song plays
That smile when you brush your hair away
The things that you do when you don't say
Keep working on me
It's the way that you walk when you walk by
The way that you come off a little shy
The way you're all up in my mind
Where you oughta be, and it just keeps
Working on me don't know if you know it
Everything you do just gets me going
Baby, you're driving me crazy
You got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time you're doin' whatever
You're doing to me
Girl can't you see
It's working on me
All that it takes is a little touch
There you go making my heart rush
It's got to be more than a little crush
When I can barely breathe
You better believe
It's working on me, don't know if you know it
Everything you do just gets me going
Baby, you're driving me crazy
You got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time your doin' whatever
You're doing to me
Girl can't you see, its working on me
Look what you done now
Can't go back
To far gone now
Keep it coming
Cause girl I just can't get enough, can't get enough
Yeah, you got my head spinning like a vinyl record
Gets me every time you're doin' whatever
You're doing to me
Girl can't you see
It's working on me
Keep on working on me

It's perfect outside, it's like God let me dial up the weather
Got the whole crew here, I ain't seen some of them in forever
It's one of those 'never forget it; better stop and take it in' kind of scenes
Everything's just right, yeah, except for one thing

You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up cracking a cold beer
Saying cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here


You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone
Showing them off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't, yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face

You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up cracking a cold beer
Saying cheers
Hey y'all, it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Oh, you should be here

You'd be loving this
You'd be freaking out
You'd be smiling
Yeah, I know you'd be all about
What's going on right here, right now
God, I wish somehow
You could be here
Oh, you should be here

Yeah, this is one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
Oh, you should be here


You should be here

You know where I might be
Any given Saturday night
You know what dress to wear
How to make it look just right
When you walk by
How to smile like you just don't care
You know what drink I like
You know which songs I love
When you hit that dance floor
You know how to mess me up
How to make me love ya
No, girl, it just ain't fair

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that it might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

I know you remember
We shared that dance one night
Yeah, we got so close
Underneath that neon light
Then, it was over
You said you had to go
But I made you hold up
Put my number in your phone
I thought you'd hit me up
Later, when you got back home
But I never heard from you
And I'm still hangin' on

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

Yeah, you've got my number
But you act like
You don't even know me
And girl it ain't right
You push my buttons
And act like it ain't nothin', baby

You've got my number
Yeah, baby, you know me
You've got me wonderin'
How good that end might be
If I could kiss you
Spend a little time with you, girl
You love to drive me
A hundred miles right out of my mind
You love to make me
Think what it might be like
If I could hold ya
But, no, you're just a tease
You've got my number
But you ain't callin' me

Yeah, you've got me fallin'
But, girl, you ain't callin'
Ain't callin' me

Now girl I know you used to the same old same
But we ain't floatin' that boat, no we ain't ridin' that train
Hop on my rocket ship and let's get outta here
Let me put a little shimmer in your atmosphere

Now let's get outta this town, outta this club
Girl whatever you're sippin' I'mma mix it up
Take a few tick tocks off of your clock
Put a little Third Rock in your hip-hop
I got that

1994, Joe Diffie comin' out my radio
I'm just a country boy with a farmer's tan
So help me girl I'll be your pick-up man
How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose
'Bout to bust out my honky-tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994

Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie

Girl don't you worry, now your ship just came in
So go on tell your mama, tell all your friends
That your new favorite color is John Deere green
Hop in this truck aka Time Machine



Baby if you're lookin' for a good time
Let me take you to the C-O-U-N-T-R-Y
Now baby let's go, holler if you're with me
Hey Joe, come on and teach us how to Diffie


Hey Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Will the real Joe Diffie please stand up

Pain it's only a little pain
It'll be gone in a couple of days
Or maybe a life or two
Heart it's only my poor heart
Just that little thing you tore apart
It ain't no headline news

But a grown woman should've known better
Than to treat me like some old lipstick
You use up and throw away
Hey, hey, hey

Time I wish I could turn back time
To when you were just a child
And teach you a thing or two
About love it's okay if you wanna give up
But there's a way to leave someone
And you don't have to be so cruel

You're supposed to treat your lover
At least as good as your neighbor
So how could you, a grown woman
Not know no better
I ain't no lipstick you use up and throw away
Cause you're ready for another shade
Hey, hey, hey
You should've known better
Cause you're a grown woman
They boarded up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging 'round
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay
If that sun would have just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little bit yeah
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in
Like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough
If that sun would have just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little yeah
Just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at her feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in
Like a warm southern whisper on her
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
Just a little more summertime
If that sun would have just
Hung up in that sky
Just a little yeah
Just a little bit longer
She might have stayed forever
And never ever left these arms
If only I
Had a little more summertime
If you'd a got here 'fore my buzz kicked in
I'd a told you where to go, I'd a never let you in
Crashed out on the couch waitin' on that sun to come up
I'd probably still be hating on you
Saying I'm just glad it's over, actin' like that was the truth
I'd still have my walls, girl, I wouldn't care at all
So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer
I wish that you'd go find somebody new
And I wish I had it in me, to just have one or two
I wish I could draw a line, stick to it just one time
But I'm drunk tonight, so never mind
So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here is when you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer
You got me where you want me girl, no I can't stand it
Looks like tonight's gonna go just the way you planned it
So why you gotta wait until I'm gone to come around
When I ain't got no fight left I got no way out
When I'm 12 in, helpless
The only time you show up here
Is when I'm 12 in, helpless
Girl you know I'm gonna give in
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer
When you're lonely
And I'm all out of beer

He gets up before the dawn;
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze;
Those burning rays are wearing down his body
The diesels worth the price of gold;
It is the cheapest grain he is ever sold
But he is still holding on

He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says: "Lord, I never complain, I never ask: 'Why?'
"Please don't let my dreams run dry
"Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"

That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays: "Please let my crops and children grow"
Because that is all he is ever known



And he takes the tractor another round. 
Another round 
Another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says: "I never complain, I never ask: 'Why?'
"Please do not let my dreams run dry
"Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky
"Underneath this Amarillo Sky"
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Ask any ol' barstool
I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
Before the Vietnam war came along
Before The Beatles and 'Yesterday'
When a man could still work, still would
The best of the free life behind us now
And are the good times really over for good?
Are we rolling down hill
Like a snowball headed for Hell?
With no kind of chance
For the Flag or the Liberty Bell
Wish a Ford and a Chevy
Could still last ten years, like they should
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
Are the good times really over for good?
I wish Coke was still Cola
And a joint was a bad place to be
It was back before Nixon lied to us all on TV
Before microwave ovens
When a girl could still cook and still would
The best of the free life behind us now
Are the good times really over for good?
Are we rolling down hill
Like a snowball headed for Hell?
With no kind of chance
For the Flag or the Liberty Bell
Wish a Ford and a Chevy
Could still last ten years, like they should
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
Are the good times really over for good?
Stop rolling down hill
Like a snowball headed for Hell
Stand up for the Flag
And let's all ring the Liberty Bell
Let's make a Ford and a Chevy
Still last ten years like they should
The best of the free life is still yet to come
The good times ain't over for good

The sun has opened up my eyes
And I do not want to leave your side
For that lonesome road but here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel
Of 50 feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I am on a ride that would not let me go

I am an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride ride
Till I am back in your arms again
I will be out here on the wind

And sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I would like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair and your kiss
Girl that is what I miss
Still I drive these horses through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know

I am an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride ride
Till I am back in your arms again
I will be out here on the wind

And I will ride
Till I am back in your arms again
I will be out here on the wind
And I will ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
I am on a ride that would not let me go
It's 2 A.M. in my new home, this motel room
An ashtray full of Lucky Strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Light
Counting regrets, fighting back tears
Retracin' steps, gettin' nowhere
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette
Come sunrise, guess I'll check out and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' till I finally mend my broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here, I'll lose my mind
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette
I may never know your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good in your goodbye
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryin' to put smoke back in this cigarette

It's Two A.M. in my new home this motel room
An ash tray full of lucky strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Lite
Counting regrets...fighting back tears
Retracin' steps...gettin' nowhere

Callin' your name it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like trying to put smoke back in this cigarette

Come sunrise guess I'll check out and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' till I finally mend this broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here I'll lose my mind

Callin' your name it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like trying to put smoke back in this cigarette
I may never know your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good in your goodbye

Callin' your name it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like trying to put smoke back in this cigarette
When you're good, girl you're good
Doing every little thing exactly like you should
So sweet, with your angel eyes just killin' me
On the porch, blue sky
Yeah you hold my hand say you want to take a Sunday drive
It's all good, when you're good
But when you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better
When you're good, girl you're good
When you're countin' the stars in the sky layin' back
On the hood, talkin' 'bout
How you want to stay here 'til the moon goes out
With your head, on my chest
One innocent little kiss
Aw it's so good, so good, when you're good
When you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better
Yeah I love every side of you
All the wrong and the right of you
All the day and the nighttime too
But you're the best I've ever had
When you're bad
And you're lookin' at me just like that
Reach up and you take my hat and you turn it around
Steal my drink and you shoot it on down
When you're wild, child, flashin' that come here smile
Spinnin' in your little red dress
Show a little too much
When you dance like that
Sayin' look don't touch
I never know what I'll get when we get together
When you're good, you're good
But when you're bad, you're better
Girl when you're bad you're better

She had a shiny little beamer with the ragtop down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
And I just laughed and said you all get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I don't care
We can go to the show
We can stay right here

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house

Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust of the seat
Put your pretty little arms around me
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor

She puts on her work clothes, fishnet pantyhose
She is got a nickname everybody knows at the gentlemen's club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right
Makes her money one dollar at a time
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name
And she wears the pain

Black tears, rolling down
From the eyes of an angel in a sinner's town
She reveals, and they all cheer
Then she cries, black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she is convinced
The boss man is still a friend she needs
She's tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
The wrong kind of famous in her momma's eyes
You can tell she knows it when she cries


She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody is watching


You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin', cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me

Ain't a whole lot going on
Small town friday night
Revving up at a red light
On your mark, get set, go
Pass a mom and pop restaurant
Same four trucks parked out front
I guess ya gotta make your own fun
When you're stuck in a place this slow
There's only two means of salvation around here that seem to work
Whiskey or the bible, a shot glass or revival
When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
Yeah, yeah
In this church pew or bar stool kinda town?

I'm like that am station
That never comes in right
Till you pass that city limit sign
That's the only time it all gets clear
It's crystal clear that I
Just need to find
A place where there's no lines
Nothing like it is around here
Someplace where it don't feel like this world revolves around

Whiskey or the bible, a shot glass or revival
When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kinda town?

Here it sometimes feels just like this world revolves around
Whiskey or the bible, shot glass or revival
When you don't seem to run on either side of the fence
People act like you don't make sense
These big town dreams that I've been chasing
Will never come true if I wind up staying
And I don't want to fall in the same rut that everybody here seems to be stuck in now
Why do I hang around
In this church pew or bar stool kinda town?
Yeah I need to get out
Of this church pew or bar stool kinda town
I usually tell you take your time
Go 45, ease in your drive
I put it in park, come inside
While you get ready
We lay it back, we take it slow
We put the night on cruise control
Whatcha wanna do, where you wanna go
I don't care baby
Been fixin' fence, been runnin' roads
Missing you like crazy
Girl, when I come to town tonight
I'm comin' in hot
Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
Girl I already stopped by the store
Can in a koozie sittin' in your door
Cooler in the back if you want some more
No, I ain't playin
You'll love the spot that I picked out
Where the stars and the moon come shining down
Won't be anybody else around, look out
I'm comin' in hot
Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
Like a summer black top
Like a 30 ought shot
Like I'm runnin' from the cops
To get to you girl
Like these 35 tires
Just caught on fire
Baby ready or not
I'm comin' in hot
Already got your song on
When you climb in it'll be playin'
Been thinking 'bout you all week long
Oh baby don't keep me waiting
You've got about 45 minutes tops
'Fore I roll in there ready to rock
Comin' to get some of what you got
Girl I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
I'm comin' in hot
Yeah I'm comin' in hot

She was raised up in Jersey
I said oh Lord have mercy
Never seen a one light town 'till she moved down here
She said I'm so bored out of my mind
Need a Starbucks and a wifi
Or a jet airliner to fly me anywhere
I said do you wanna take a drive in my truck
Don't pay no mind to that 12 point buck
Laid across my hood
You ever been to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Been to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
Just give me a chance to change your mind
So before you go and fly away girl
Let me show you 'round a country boy's world

Somewhere between there on a dirt road
When I rolled down my window
She smelled wildflowers on the summer wind
With just a bite of homemade ice cream
And a glass of Momma's sweet tea
This ole holler's got a way of making' friends
She'd never seen a glowing' field of fireflies
Or the twinkle of a star in a southern sky
She fell in love
We went down to

Rome Georgia
Picked peaches off the trees
Climbed the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Been to Florence Alabama
Drank muscadine wine
Just give me a chance to change your mind
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy's world

Oh now she's riding shotgun
Saying' baby let's run wild
And go down to

Rome Georgia
Pick peaches off the trees
Climb the water tower in Paris Tennessee
Go to Florence Alabama
Drink Muscadine wine
She gave me a chance and I made her mine
Says she'll never fly away and she's my girl
It's 'cause I showed her 'round a country boy's world

Roll into town step off the bus
Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab you guitar walk down the street
Sign says Nashville Tennessee
But I have found

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang bang bang
Bend those strings 'till the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it
In this crazy town

You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the Smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
'Till you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang bang bang
Bend those strings 'till the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it
In this crazy town

One year they reposes your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks

It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to 
Bend those strings till the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it
We love it we hate it we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town

Ain't no cloud up in my sky
I couldn't worry if I tried
I got an open road just daring me
To pick you up and take you for a ride

I got a new shine on my car
Sun is turning' my left arm
And while I'm waiting' on the red light
I'm burning' up a little air guitar

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up, I love this song
Come on, girl, the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong
Life is short, let's go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these  they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these  you wanna make them last

Rest your feet up on the dash
Leave your toe prints on the glass
Sing it like you mean it, baby
Close your eyes and lay your head on back

What'd ya say?
What was that?

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up, I love this song
Come on, girl, the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong
Life is short, let's go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these  they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these  you wanna make them last

Speakers laying in the truck bed
Know this day ain't done yet
Till the sun goes down

Turn it up a little bit louder
Turn it up, I love this song
Come on, girl, the world is ours
Let's do something right or wrong
Life is short, let's go live it
Ain't no time for wasting time
Days like these  they go by way too fast
Yeah, days  like these  they go by way too fast
Yeah, days like these  you wanna make them last

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack'n'Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking, man, ya'll ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missing

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised, and our southern ways
And we like cornbread, and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where ya need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods

We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires
I'm chilling on a dirt road
Laid back swerving like I'm George Jones
Smoke Rolling out the window
An' ice cold beer sitting' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turning off of real life, driving' that's right
I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires
That's right

Yeah I'm chilling on the dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires

Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
You better mind your business man watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking man y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'


Man Im feeling like a million dollars
Stacked up all hundred dollar bills
Got a whole six-pack on ice
But Im ridin on the hottest wheels,
Seat back and I'm perwin' swervin'
Put my pedal to the metal like I'm racing
Turn it up and let the speakers scream for Mr. Aldean
But I call him Jason
Reminiscing on the good times
Water balloons, super soakers
Wet T-shirts, women in bikinis
Kenny Rogers penny loafers
Smoke blowin' out the window
And all my problems aside
Just feel that summer breeze
Lay back, kick it and enjoy the ride

I can keep on changing the song
Keep on changing stations
Til I finally land on one
I don't mind that they keep playing
I'd take a different road through town
I find another way around
Change it up, really shake it up
Yeah, I'm trying
But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone
I can keep on hanging around
But I don't see me staying
Strike a match and burn it down
Walk out and leave it laying
Don't think about a thing just drive
Far enough til I find a change of scene
A new routine, I'd try anything
But it don't change gone, won't bring her back
She's moved on, and I'm stuck with that
I could change whatever I want
But it don't change
Headlights fading, nothing was breaking
She's gone
Yeah, I could change whatever I want
But it don't change gone
No it don't change gone

I don't go to church enough
I curse out loud, I drink too much
I'm more of a sinner than a saint
Got a dusty Bible on my shelf
I just pick it up when I need help
Lord knows there's a lot I need to change
And I want to, baby, you make me want to

You tie the knot
When I'm at the end of my rope
You never stop believing in me
When I don't know who I am
Or what I'm supposed to be
I don't give you no good reason
But baby, don't give up on me

I've smoke my last cigarette
At least a hundred times I bet
I guess I'll just keep quitting till it sticks
But for all the things I've failed to do
I've never failed at loving you
We both know I can't grant your every wish
But I want to, baby, you make me want to

You tie the knot
When I'm at the end of my rope
You never stop believing in me
When I don't know who I am
Or what I'm supposed to be
I don't give you no good reason
But baby, don't give up on me
You tie the knot
When I'm at the end of my rope
You never stop believing in me
When I don't know who I am
Or what I'm supposed to be
I don't give you no good reason
But baby, don't give up on me

I really hate to let this moment go
Touching your skin, and your hair falling slow
When a goodbye kiss, feels like this

Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye


Oh yeah
Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
Yeah, you feel so perfect, baby

Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?

Do you wish it was me?
When the sun slowly chases the moon from the sky
And touches your face as you open your eyes
What are you thinking? Do you like what you see?
Is it all that you dreamed of or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you've chosen free from regret?
Or is what might have been just to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

I know you that did what you thought you should do
It was safe and secure so completely thought through
But you sacrificed passion and abandoned your dreams
Baby, was it all worth it or do you wish it was me?
Does each kiss seem closer to the first or the last?
Is the fire still raging or has it burned down to ash?
Do the memories haunt you? Do they beg and they pled?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

Is the life that you've chosen free from regret?
Or is what might have been just to hard to forget?
Has the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?
Are you satisfied baby or do you wish it was me?

Are you satisfied baby? mmm...yeah
Or Do you wish it was me?
Do you wish it was me?
Oh, Do you wish it was me?
Do you wish it was me?
Do you wish it was me?
Do you wish it was me?

You do not know how bad
I wish I was home
Cannot wait to get back
But while I am gone
Y'all carry on

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I have ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one for me

I cannot count the miles
It just feels so far
And it could be a while
Till I'm where you are
So keep me in your heart

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I have ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one-

For the ones you can't be with
The ones we will always miss
And times like this
And times like this

Drink one for me, for all the old times
We tore up that town, raised hell alright
Tell the boys, thanks for having my back
Some of the best memories I have ever had
So go on and get crazy
And drink one for me

I am on the brink; I can barely think
With all of these thoughts running through my head
Wondering if I did you wrong?
No way, I did you wrong
Every night, I try to justify
All the angry things I said, oh, but I cannot take them back
No, I cannot do that
I was wrong, oh, but now you are gone

And I cannot hide what I feel inside
And just stop loving you even if I wanted to
I cannot hold on, but letting go
Is something I cannot do
Is something I cannot do
Even if I wanted to

All the times I sat and watched you cry
When I should have held you close, made sure that you know
How much I cared but I was never there
I was wrong And now you have moved on

And I cannot hide what I feel inside
And just stop loving you even if I wanted to
I cannot hold on, but letting go
Is something I cannot do
Is something I cannot do
Even if I wanted to


And I cannot hide what I feel inside
And just stop loving you even if I wanted to
I cannot hold on, but letting go
Is something I cannot do
Is something I cannot do
Even if I wanted to

Goodbye crack of dawn
Goodbye harvester
Goodbye hello baby
After a long hard day
Of plowing dirt
Goodbye way of life
Goodbye pass it down
Goodbye up all night
Of praying for rain
A two year drought
Walking on faith
And toughing it out

Hey, what's past is past
Oh, nothing in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Goodbye gravel road
Thanks for the ride
For watching over me
Remember the time
I rolled my truck
And you were there
When I woke up
You walked me home
Yeah, you lead me home

But hey, what's past is past
Oh, nothing in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Goodbye, tomorrow's another day
In no time it only moves one way
Away from yesterday
But memories never fade

What's past is past
Oh nothing, nothing in this world lasts
Hey, aren't those four lanes fast?

Aren't they fast?
What's past is past
Aren't they fast?
Aren't they fast?

A river in July, two kids on summer break
Another record high, clothes scattered on the bank
The rush of jumping in, I want to feel that again
Sun going down, build a fire in the dirt
You're dancing all around wearing my t-shirt
The way you pull me in, I want to feel that again

Guitar coming through the speakers
That song you never want to end
Give me some of that you and me
Some of that way back when
A little bit of wild and free
I want to feel that again

Nothing but a blur, gravel road, a flatbed Ford
Always was the cure, ooh whenever we got bored
Sideways round the bend, yeah I want to feel that again
 
The mention of your name
That's all it takes
My heart re-breaks
My whole world shakes
And it's flashback driveway pouring rain
Nothing I could do nothing I could say
To slow you down
And right now
It's like the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
It could start with an old song
Feeling you come on
It could be at a party
Seeing everybody
And I'm right back wishing you were right back here
Wishing that missing you would just disappear
But it don't and it won't
And baby here I go
It's like the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
Oh, for the first time again
It don't let up, it don't get better
Hell it just might last forever
But it all takes me back
It all takes me back
To the first time watching you walk away
Begging baby please just stay
Feeling every second of the clock tick by
On an endless night
The first time seeing you with someone new
Dying inside trying to play it cool
It don't matter how long it's been
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
I'm always missing you
For the first time again
For the first time again

A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states


Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride
Couple guys in first class on a flight from New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk, killin' time, flirtin' with the flight attendants
Thirty thousand feet above what would be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square corn fields and wheat farms, man it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd wanna live down there, in the middle of nowhere
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the man who plowed that Earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made those fly over states
I bet that mile haul in Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flat bed cowboy stacking U.S. steel on a three day haul
Roads and rails under their feet, yeah that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made those fly over states
Take a ride across the Badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made...
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Yeah
Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride
You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years but they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here
People talk girl
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah we may not be around in 20 years but they're sure gonna know we were here
We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby let go and remember our name
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
Yeah we may not be around in 20 years
Oh, we may not be around in 20 years, but they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here

Waiting at a stop light yesterday
As a funeral procession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a winding road
Through a field of green with white headstones
All in a row
And it made me think about where I am at
On my not so straight and narrow path
All the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I have had

I had an all-American Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I would never find
Sometimes I cannot believe this life is mine
And I am not planning on leaving yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I am good to go
I am good to go

I said a prayer for the dearly departed
An, the loved ones left broken hearted
Then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
And that I am grateful
Because I have had my troubles, I have had my trials;
I have hit the mark and I have missed by miles
Had days that I have been fighting mad
But the good times have more than outweighed the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I have laughed so hard, I could not stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I am not planning on leaving yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I am good to go


Yeah, I have been thinking about where I am at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I would not want to change nothing about
This "roll with the punches" life I have had

I had an all-American Mom and Dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I would never find
I cannot believe this life is mine
And I am not planning on leaving yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I am good to go
I am good to go
I am good to go

Oh, you like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jacking up his Bronco
He is going to lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are getting pretty. They are spraying on the White Rain
Yeah, they are going to get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

Yeah, we let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that is the way we get down
In a Hick town

Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman smoking Pall Mall is watching Laura Ingalls
And Granny is getting lit, she is heading out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies And me are going mudding down on Blue Hole Road




We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio
 

Got your country boys and your redneck girls
It is the party heard round the world
Right here in Hicktown
In Hicktown
The whole town is getting down
In Hicktown
Yeah, in Hicktown

There's something about lightening up a Marlboro red
That nicotine rush into my head
And a taste of southern comfort on my lips
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

Something about driving way to fast
Switching gears and hammering on the gas
And the fact that they ain't called me yet
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you ain't seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of waking up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

There's something about the way you say my name
That drives this old country boy insane
So baby don't don't stop loving me like this
Cause I ain't ready to quit


Don't start thinking I'm gonna stop
Girl I'm giving it all I got
If you think you seen love you ain't seen nothing yet
How could I ever get tired
Of waking up by your side
And the taste of your sweet kiss
And the taste of your sweet kiss
Tells me I ain't ready to quit

I have never been superstitious
I have never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me
I have believed in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

Well I am haunted by a memory
That would not leave or let me go
Call me crazy and I may be
But I believe in ghosts
Girl, I believe in ghosts

I swear I keep seeing shadows
I know that I am not alone
I feel the temperature dropping
And it chills me to the bone


Should I be afraid, should I be scared
You follow me everywhere, I am haunted
Call me crazy Hell I may be
But I believe in ghosts


I have never been superstitious
I have never feared the unknown
But ever since you left me baby
I have believed in ghosts

If it's gonna happen, then it's gonna happen
That's just the way that it is
Oh love comes along and it don't take long
Till it slips through my fingertips
I could make some excuses, but darling the truth is
I'm just the reckless kind
And I don't wanna leave you to pick up the pieces
Oh no matter how I try

Girl, I break everything I touch
Little girl thats close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

I can't look in your eyes and tell you a lie
I'd love to leave here with you
Oh but darling the fact is
I'm always attracted to everything I shouldn't do
Oh so you better know, before I lose control
Before we throw it all to chance
Girl your welcome to stay, but all I've got to say
Before you lay your heart in my hands


Well I break everything I touch
Little girl thats close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch
Yeah I break everything I touch
Little girl thats close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch

Baby since you have been gone
I leave the TV on
Got to hear somebody's voice
I just need some kind of noise
I lay some pillows down
To wrap my arms around
I pretend I am holding you
I know it is sad but it is what I do
To keep me from going crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well

I got some real good friends
Check on me now and then
Try to get me out at night
Say I need to get a life
It is easy to say alright
When you are not the one going crazy

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well

Here comes another sunset
Here comes another long night
I am not over you yet
No I am not over you yet

I can get up and face the day
Just fine all by myself
Go out and take on the world
And get it done like nobody else
Oh but I don't do lonely well
Twelve gauge, old Ford, buckshot floorboard, don't ask
Fence post, door dent, let's just leave it at that
It's got dirt on me, yeah I'd be up a tree
If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk
Those two headlights, looked in her eyes, how she danced
Moonlit truck bed, two kids, enough said, yeah man
All that went on, goes on my own
It can go on and on and on
If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk
If my truck could talk I couldn't deny a word it said
I'd just smile and shake my head, yeah
It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk, if my truck could talk
If my truck could talk
There wasn't a stone I didn't throw
When I wrecked it
My foolish words so cruel and cold
Were disconnected
Tell me why, when she cried
All I did was close my eyes
But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now
Now the sunshine feels like rain
Trying to drown me
And the world feels out of place
All around me
So I wait and I pray
That I'll run into her someday
But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now
There's so many things
I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her
Miss her, love her
But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now
But if she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now
If she could see me now

Wasn't a stone I didn't throw, when I wrecked it
My foolish words so cruel and cold, We're disconnected
Tell me why, when she cried, all I did was close my eyes

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now

Now the sunshine feels like rain, trying to drown me
And the world feels out of place, all around me
So I wait, and I pray, I'll run into her someday


So many things I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her, miss her, love her

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around
If she could see me now, If she could see me now

I am a blue collar man, had a hammer in my hand
For the last few years of my life
Working a double overtime while you sleep alone at night
Baby I know it is been a long hard ride
Sometimes I forget to say "I love you"
But baby, please know that I do, yeah

I live this life everyday
I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I have learned, I have learned the hard way
I do the best that I can
And I hope you understand
After all, I am just a man

I found a postcard that you have saved; it is turned yellow with age
Of a beautiful place in the sun
We have been saying, every year, that we are going to go there
And run away. Just the two of us
Well, I put that picture back on your dresser
Grab my keys; I got to get back to work, yeah



In case you don't remember
I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break
We were young and a little bit crazy enough to just think
We were gonna be something
Yeah weren't we something
A little bit burned a little bit buzzed didn't feel it
Still got the hat that you wore flip back I wear it
Yeah I swear it
There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember
I still got the key to the room that we never slept in
Yeah the love we made you let it fade away well I kept it
And I don't regret it
There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
It was us against the world and you swore girl that we'd never surrender
But I still can't forget you girl
In case you don't remember
The last time we kissed
The taste of my lips
The way we couldn't say goodbye
There was magic in the air it was everywhere that we touched down
The carnival ride and the high we were on as it went around
There was something in the way that you swore girl
That we'd never surrender but I still can't forget you girl
No I won't ever forget you girl
In case you don't remember
I left a picture of us on the hood of your truck from that spring break

I walk a hard line winding road
Don't really know where it's gonna go
Seems like trouble's my best friend
Soon as I get out, I'm back in again
It's a wonder, I ain't all alone

'Cause it ain't easy
No, It ain't easy
It ain't easy, Loving me

Don't why know I do the things I do
Must be I love to light the fuse
Stand back and watch it crash and burn and turn into ash
Just like it ain't nothing
She ain't something I can lose

She's the brick by brick that built this house
Without her it would all fall down
So now she finds the faith and the strength to believe
Don't know why she sticks around

When I passed that city limit sign
I knew that I was finally on my own
So I put my foot down on the gas
To see how fast those wheels could get me going
Everything about that place made me who I am
But they say once you leave you can't go back again
So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me
They say this world can change you fast
Kick you right on back where you belong
I rolled my sleeves up every day
That's just what you do where I come from
Everything I ever knew I bottled up inside
What I'd leave your side at back home
It ain't hard to find
So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me
I'd be a thousand miles away
But it's still crystal clear
I see that picture in my mind
I keep with right here
So I took it with me, that cloud of red dust rolling up
That Georgia blue sky, setting sun, straight up highway forty-one
I took it with me, that wild street, that fighting size
That on the run on a Friday night
That standing tall small town crowd
I took it with me

Nobody ever thought I'd make it in this town
They all said I should leave my truck, pack, and turn right back around
They said I didn't have what it takes
I needed money and a pretty face
But I just look at them and say...

I use what I got
Take what I get
Until I ain't got nothin' left
Then I give it some more
Keep on climbing up that mountain
Keep truckin along, work up a sweat
Pass every no, after no, after no, till I get a yes
I don't worry about what i've done
I use what I got, yeah

I still got big dreams and a strong heart
I got a lot of real good friends who helped me get this far
I still got a lot of miles to go
It's a winding, uphill road
And I'll get there the only way I know


Keep on rollin' along, doin' my best
Past every no after no after no til I get a yes
I don't worry about what I'm not
No, no, I don't worry about what I'm not
I use what I got, yeah

I'm Jason Aldean. This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone, I'm struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and heal. So many are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They're all part of our family. So I wanna say to them: we hurt for you, and we hurt with you. But you can be sure that we're gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit it's unbreakable
Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out

Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I'll stand my ground
And I won't back down

Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out

Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out

Hey, I won't back down

Hey, baby, there ain't no easy way out

Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, we won't back down


Quit my job flipped off the boss took my name off the payroll

Picked up my cell rang my baby's bell said I'm three miles from home
I said sugar why don't you put on that sundress I like so much
Wait out by the road I'm comin' to pick you up


Throw your suitcase in the back

Done gassed up the Pontiac

Blastin' out to Johnny Cash, headin' for the highway
Baby we ain't ever comin' back

It's four hundred and sixty seven miles to the outskirts of Las Vegas
What do you say we go get married by a preacher man that looks like Elvis

Sugar don't you worry bout tellin' your momma goodbye
We'll send her a souvenir postcard from the wild side





Hear that train a comin', rollin' round the bend

The man in black is gonna rock your ass again



I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a 6 pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slippin' off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moon light left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
And we're just getting started tonight

I can hear that rooster crowing down the road
I felt my eyes open up real slow and I looked around making sure I hadn't checked out
Because there was an angel lying next to me
And I figured heavens where I must be oh but it was you and baby what else could I do
In that bed I said a little prayer for one more day I'm still here

It's your world and I'm just in it, ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you girl, it's your world, and I'm just passing through

I dig in my heels and try to slow this down
I want my life to revolve around everything you do, aw but that's all up to you
Everything good seems to go so fast it's like one big party crash
You weren't counting on one day you're here and gone
Baby all I wanna do is lay here and hope it don't disappear

It's your world and I'm just in it, ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you girl, it's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your world and I'm just in it, ain't no other way to spin it
Lucky me, just being there when I get to hold you
I'm just here to love you girl, it's your world, and I'm just passing through
I'm just here to love you girl, it's your world, and I'm just passing through

This life is full of choices
Hard to make one
All the voices in my head
Those blue eyes I'm in love with
Or that highway which ever I pick
There'll be regrets
I go one way I lose everything
I go the other way same thing

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's going to cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Chase the dream or keep the girl

More than once I packed it all up
But I break down blame it on the truck
Just couldn't go 
Just want to be out there making my mark
Lay down every night in her arms

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's going to cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Chase the dream or keep the girl

I don't know why I can't have it all
Need to tear down that wall
Between this little town, that big old world
Go chase my dream and keep the girl

I'm torn and it's tearing me apart
I want to go but I don't want to break her heart
Like a sword with a double edge blade
It's going to cut deep either way
This little town, that big old world
Go chase the dream and keep the girl

I want it all, keep the girl, hey
Got our headlights circled, Chevrolet
Saturday night at a river bank
Silver bullets popping, got my speakers rocking
A feel good song that'll take you back
Watching them pretty girls work that
Baby, shake it just right, I could do this all night
Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back
There's no last call or closing time
Just good stuff passing left and right
Let that homemade hit you
You know I'll be right there with you
Dancing in the dust and half past gone
Turn it on up and sing along
Don't matter what you got playing
Wanna see your body swaying
Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back
Out here way back, you can feel that country high
Out here way back, you can do what you want to do tonight
Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back
Out here way back, working on our laid back
Tell everyone you know
Sip it, tip it, pass it around
Let's light up this two lane town
Out here way back, working on our laid back

Going through my closet the other day
Found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip down there on that Panama strip
We all started yelling when we smelled the beach
Just couldn't wait to try our fake ids
We only had a few days, and a whole lot of memories to make

Oh man we were livin, didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and
Danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

This past year my family
Was sittin cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin to granddad, we all knew it would probably be his last
He was crackin jokes and we were takin turns
Tellin stories bout fishing or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him we all felt like kids again

Oh man we were livin, sittin' there reminiscin'
Yeah, we sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried

It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, A little of that
Kinda happy, Kinda sad
Just the other night the baby was cryin
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile and I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
My mind went back to a few years ago
We tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you comin' in and tellin me the news
Oh man we were livin, goin crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried

You're a crack-of-dawn, Monday-morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe-riding king of beers, 18-wheeler
Driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six-string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide
Cause it's time to live it up
So come on and raise your cup

If we're talkin' 'bout memories, yeah, we're gonna make 'em
Talkin' 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on

Yeah, we all the same cause we thinkin' the same thing
Yeah, we all the same cause we thinkin' the same thing
We on the same page cause we sippin' the same drink
We on the same page cause we sippin' the same drink
Here's a little something to thank y'all for showing up
Aldean and the boys about to blow it up, haha

When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to a girl to take it home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
Your boy's blowing it up
It's going all night long
When the lights come on

Drove half way to town last night and I turned around
In a field of fireflies making such a lonely sound
As my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
I realized that I was living in a new zip code

Well, I am living in Lonesome, USA
Population one since yesterday
Living and dying in the hell I made since you been gone
Right now, my mind is in another state;
Is not enough heart here left to break?
I am living in Lonesome, Lonesome, USA

I never knew the sound of silence could be so loud
It is hard getting used to living in an empty house
Yeah, I know I can come and go any time I please
But there is something I miss about you waiting up on me


Hey, I could drive all night and be right here where I am
And still be just as lost till you come back
Hey, I look around here and it does not take long to see
Oh, where I am right now is no place to be


Lonesome, USA
Population one since yesterday
Living and dying in the hell I made since you been gone
Right now, my mind is in another state;
Is not enough heart here left to break?
I am living in Lonesome, Lonesome, USA
Hey, I am living in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
Hey, I am living in Lonesome, Lonesome USA

It seems like money
Is always on our minds these days
Make more, spend more
Worry how the bills will get paid
Oh, it wasn't that long ago
But it seems so far away
When we didn't have a damn thing
But we were happy

And love was easy
Just laying on a river bank
All night counting the stars
Love was easy
As that feeling we found
In the back seat of my car
Even in the dark
Love was easy
When we didn't make it so hard

Can you tell me
The last time we really laughed?
The last time we had a moment
When we hated that the moment passed
Here we are down the road
Standing here looking back
Seeing what we used to have
Is what we're missing

When love was easy
Just laying on a river bank
All night counting the stars
Love was easy
As that feeling we found
In the back seat of my car
Even in the dark
Love was easy
When we didn't make it so hard
Yeah

Maybe that's how it is
Ah, maybe that's how it goes
But all I know

Is love was easy
Just laying on a river bank
All night counting the stars
Love was easy
As that feeling we found
In the back seat of my car
Even in the dark
Love was easy
When we didn't make it so hard
When we didn't make it so hard

Love was easy, baby, yeah
When we didn't make it so hard
I found your silver bracelet in my backseat
That you left, it seems like yesterday
It's like I found a treasure when I held it
How could I have ever let her get away
I still got a faded picture on my rearview
It's almost like she's looking right at me
Somehow just like that, it all comes rushing back
She's right here the way it used to be
Yeah, miss that girl
Knowing they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl
Way back then it felt like I had things together
Whenever she'd coming smiling through that door
But I've had one or two tonight
And it just makes me realize
That I ain't so together anymore
And I miss that girl
Knowing they'll never be another one like her, not like her
Kicking myself for ever letting her slip out of my world
I just miss that girl

I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
Shes a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it theres gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And Ill find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
Its my kinda party

If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while well sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
Ill be your Redneck Romeo

Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And Ill find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank

It must have been a mountain standing in our way
Or some small misunderstanding
We talked about too late
Was it the kitchen or the bedroom
Where we let a good thing go
Was it destined dreams, or space we needed?
I don't know

Baby, lately my memory
Ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
Cause baby it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye

Maybe time's just playing tricks on me these days
Or maybe these old feelings never went away
Cause all that I remember
Is that I'm still in love with you
And if I'm losing my mind, I hope you are too


It's crazy
But holding you close to me
Seeing you smile at me
Is all that I recall
Cause baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Why we said goodbye
Why did we say goodbye?

Ive been thinking bout you all day, baby
Waitin on that sun to go down
What'cha say I pick you up after work?
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little somethin' to knock off the edge
Its supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like Im going to have to hold you tight, yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it comin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, lets go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope its gonna be a long one
And if were lucky, its moving slow
Wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside
Lets go

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it comin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl I hear it comin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, lets go listen to the night train
Lets go listen to the night train

Looking back
At the dead ends and the detours
All I can do is long for a straighter line
Yeah, I was lost
I had no way of knowin'
Where the twists and turns were goin'
But sometimes you just gotta let the road wind

Could have been easier? Yeah
A little smoother ride, maybe so?
But lying here with you
Would I change one thing about that road?
No

I believe
Things happen for a reason
Even though you might not see it at the time
Cause now I know
Every plan that came unraveled
Every crooked path I traveled in my life
Led me here to your side

Yeah, I finally found you...

Could it have been easier? Yeah
A little smoother ride, maybe so?
But lying here with you
Would i change one thing bout that road?
It could have been easier, yeah
A little smoother ride, maybe so?
But lying here with you
Would i change one thing bout that road?
No

Have you ever skipped a stone across the water
Have you ever hitched a free ride on a train
Have you ever climbed up on a water tower
To write a name
The truth is, Every man dies
Not every man lives

Have you ever loved someone that you would die for
Have you ever walked too far out on a limb
Have you ever chased a dream too high to reach for
And pulled it in

Truth is Every man dies
But Not every man lives
I wanna paint outside the lines
Run the red lights in my mind
Take everything, One lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blind-folded on a wire
Every man dies
But not every man lives

Have you ever thought about how fast time passes
Ever thought about what you would leave behind
Ever stood up for something you believed in
And drawn a line


I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk Blind-folded on a wire
Every Man Dies
But Not every Man Lives
Have you ever skipped a stone across the water...
Have you ever Hitched a free ride on a train...
A cup of coffee from a waitress I ain't ever met
She asked, "Are you just passing through?"
I smiled and said, "I don't know yet."
I walked around the town square
Down the street to where
I met the preacher and the old courthouse man
Yeah, nothing helps you start again like
Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through, man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt
There's a thousand faces that I ain't seen before
The only history that I can see is from the civil war
It's good for me to look around
Go down roads she ain't been down
No memories of our "used to bes" set me free
Old boots, new dirt, no reminders
I've got a feeling this town will get me over her
You've been through what I've been through, man
Nothing feels better than old boots, new dirt
Old boots, new dirt, one step closer
Yeah, I think I'm gonna like it here, yeah
You've been through what I've been through, man
Nothing feels better than
Nothing helps you start again like old boots, new dirt
Old boots, new dirt
Ooh, old boots, new dirt
Got the visor down drivin' into the sunset
Ain't come up on your dirt road turn yet
This Chevrolet is 5 away
Just enough time to burn half a cigarette
Can't wait to see what's waitin' on me
Behind that screen door I bet it'll be
Somethin' I can't take my eyes off
Somethin' you can't wait to show off
Baby, this ain't no lay low kinda night I'm talkin' about
When you get everything just the way you like it
Come walkin' out we
Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget
You been soakin' up that sunshine all day
Sendin' some hot little pictures my way
Soakin' wet gettin' in my head
Now you're in that dress and girl I can't wait to
Take you out, spin you around
Find somewhere to lay you down
But the first thing we gotta do right now is
Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget
Baby, this ain't no lay low kinda night I'm talkin' about
It's a missin' you all day kinda thing gotta make every second count when we
Get these wheels rollin' down the road
Find us a couple cold beers to hold
Let that moonlight kiss your skin
Like I'm about to do again and again
Don't matter where we set the party down
Underneath the stars or the lights of town
In a car in a bar girl when this night ends
Let's make it one of the ones we won't forget
Yeah, one we won't forget
Yeah

On my highway the yellow lines
Disappear from time to time
And I wound up on the wrong side of the road
On my highway I've gone too fast
Afraid that I might finish last
I hugged the curve too hard and lost control
Oh you never know which way it's going to go

But what a feeling, chasing the sun
Living my life like a shot from a gun
Laughing a little bit more with every mile
Oh what a freedom racing the wind
Dying to know what's around the next bend
Smiling as I watch the years roll by
I'm learning how to take it day by day on my highway

On my highway I missed some signs
And left a damn good love behind
I see her in my rear view like a ghost
On my highway I've broken down
Cried when no one else was around
And prayed that God would save my soul
Yeah I've paid a lot of heavy tolls


Yeah, yeah
What a feeling out on the run
Drinking up the rain
Soaking up the sun
Laughing a little bit more with every mile
What a freedom, like a sail in the wind
Not looking back, not forgetting where I've been
Smiling as I watch the years roll by
And I'm moving on from my mistakes
And I'm learning how to take it day by day
On my highway

Oh, yeah

I'm about as small town as you can get
I'm talkin two lanes one cop
Plowed up fields catching red sunsets
We get nervous when the rain stops
Never had a reason to leave this place
Never had a reason to get away

The wheels just touched down in California
Man I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes

I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place
She gave me a reason to love L.A

She said she had to be where that sun dropped down
I'm talkin fast lane goodbye
She'd chase it all the way till that road ran out
And parked it underneath the pink sky
I wanna hear those waves come crashing in
I wanna feel that sand and that wind
I wanna go everywhere she's been, hold her again

The wheels just touched down in California
Man I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes

I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place...

The wheels just touched down in California
Man I don't even like to fly
I just gotta see her with the sun shining on her in the water
Chrome aviators on her eyes

I never had a reason to get away
I never had a reason to see this place
She gave me a reason to love L.A

I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Girl, your love is relentless

Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reaching out to me

I can't outrun it
Just keeps comin'
Oh your love is relentless

I can't fight it
There's no hiding
Oh your love is relentless

I'm staring at a hurricane
A hundred miles of driving rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
Cause I can't outrun it




Let's don't say goodbye
I hate the way it sounds
So if you don't mind
Let's just say for now

See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah see you when I see you
And I hope it's some day soon

God made this old world round
And maybe it's that way
So that paths that we go down
Yeah will cross again someday
And someday I'll

See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
Or you're ever up around mine
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah see you when I see you
And I hope it's some day real soon
And I hope it's some day soon

See you when I see you
Another place some other time
If I ever get down your way
If you're ever up around mine - just stop by
We'll laugh about the old days
And catch up on the new
Yeah I'll see you when i see you
'Till then my prayers are with you
And I hope it's some day soon

I'll see you when I see you

It was the summer of '89
I fell in love and I learned to drive
Me and Becky did not waste no time
Went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old
We were headed down a dead end road
But we did not care, we were on a roll
Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing
Carelessly tossing caution to the wind
We were wearing thin

We were living for the minute living every second of it
Fearless wild and free
Nothing could stop us
But one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream
But not before she loved me

To think we thought that it would last
Now looking back I have to laugh
What a mess we made of that
Now I am not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love
What it was not and what it was
It was fast and it was fun
The beginning of the end of us
But one day that road just ran out
Yeah, I still travel down it now and then, and once again


She loved me
She loved me

You boys ever met a real country girl?
Talking, true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party-all-nighter from South Carolina, a bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a raging cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk, brother she's all

Country,  from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she arent afraid to stay, country
Brother she's country

A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down, mama taught her how to rip up a town
Honey dripping honey from the hollering Kentucky
Get you flipping kind of trippie like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother she's all

Country  from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she arent afraid to stay, country
Nothing but country





Brother she's country, from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothing but country
Yea yeayeaaa
She's country  from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised she arent afraid to stay, country
Yea she's nothing but country

She's all about the country
From the backwoods she's a homegrown, down to the bone, she's country

You boys ever met a real country girl?
Talkin, true blue, out in the woods, down home, country
::Finesse::
I love them girls with that Alabama swagger
So I let her take a ride on my big green tractor
They ain't afraid to get dirty in the state of Tennessee
I love my georgia peaches and my mississippi queens
Lifted up the chevy and she gassed it up
'Cause daddy's sweet money done jacked it up 
Southern girls love those 4 wheel drives
Slingin mud and raising hell til the end of the night
She's a ragin' cajun
And she knows how to catch the eyes of Finesse and Jason
::Jason Aldean::
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother she's all
::Chorus::
Country 
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country 
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay 
Country
Brother she's country
::Finesse::
Rockin' those daisy dukes, skin tone so nice
She looks amazing, Underneath those Amarillo skies
Drinkin' down rounds she keeps it crunk in the south cause'
Momma taught her how to rip up the town
Taking chances, yeah she risky, staying tipsy, bottles empty
And She's singing Willie Nelson like a Mississippi Hippie
My Texas babe I place nothing above her
She's A
::Jason Aldean::
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother she's all
::Chorus::
Country 
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country 
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay 
Country
Nothin but country
Thick southern drawl 
Sexy swing and walk 
Aw show 'em how a country girl does it one time
::Chorus::
She's Country 
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country 
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay
Country 
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country 
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay 
Country
Yeah, She's Nothin' but country
::Finesse::
I Love chicks from all around the world
But there ain't nothing like a southern girl

I Love chicks from all around the world
But there ain't nothing like a southern girl
::Jason Aldean::
From the backwoods she's a homegrown, down to the bone, she's country
She's Country
We can go around, club hopping
Tell you all I want to do is drop in
Have a drink and catch a good band
Couple songs and hey we're gone again
Act like that's all we're doing, the truth is
I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off
Maybe take a ride down broadway
All the doctors and the Fords and the Chevrolets
Slow rolling, looking over and
Girl you've got that super cab glowing
Roll down that tinted window
There you go, I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn
Be all I ever saw, I just want to show you off
Might look like we're just cruising, truth is, truth is
I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off
I just want to show you off

She is like staring at the sun
She could easily blind someone
Other women, I see none
She is like staring at the sun

She gets on you
Under your skin like a tattoo
She will always be there
She holds on, stuck in your head like an old song
She is not going nowhere

She is like standing in the rain
Washes all my cares away
At the end of a long, hot day
She is like standing in the rain
 

She is like finally coming home
And seeing that light in the window on
After being gone too long
She is like finally coming home
Standing in the rain
Staring at the sun
Just what I had in mind
Thinking about the weekend
Standing by the Yeti with the party lights plugged in
Got a jug of feel good, going around
There's just one thing missing, baby, right about now
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
I see you dancing over there with your girlfriends
Got your fine self showing off that sun tan
You keep smiling that smile at me
Like you're reading my mind, and you know...
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
I need a sweet little somethin' like you, girl
Sliding into my world
Yeah, I've been needing it all night
Slow kinda just right
Honey suckle sweet little somethin'
I need a sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin'
Sweet little somethin' like you got
Standing there red hot, tied up little tank top
Looking like you must be straight out of the country
Honey, what I wouldn't do for a sweet little somethin' like you
I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you
The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like
I wanna ride you round in my old truck
Keep you out until the sun comes up
Girl, you got some serious
Sweet little somethin' like you
The way you slide that across the seat
Looking so damn good to me
Hey little girl right now
I need a sweet little somethin' like you

Been going round and round all day
Bailing some hay and stacking it all up
Cannot wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple Rocky Tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around 8 o'clock

Well I am just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there is nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that is a good night
Anyone from the heartland is going to understand
What I am talking about right now
There is no doubt, we got a game plan

Well I am just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there is nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you
Well I am just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there is nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

You've told me about your family
The town that you grew up in
Believe me, I want to know everything about you
And I've rambled on about me
By now you know I am crazy
We could go on all night if we wanted to
But I do not want to

I do not want to talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I want to do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't want to waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I do not want to talk anymore

That homemade wine on your lips
My name under your breath
Under one of the best river nights you ever saw
Hey, that says it all


I don't want to talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I want to do is
Find out a little bit more
I do not want to waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't want to talk anymore
I don't want to talk

I don't want to talk anymore
I know enough about you to know all I want to do is
Find out a little bit more
I don't want to waste that moon
And the heat on the hood of this Ford
I don't want to talk anymore
I don't want to talk anymore
There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick ups, and Mustangs
And weathered on the summer rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint
You can still see
"Allie will you marry me?"
Take a ride, look around
And there ain't no doubt
It sure left it's mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here, with everything we did
We laid a lotta memories down, like tattoo's on this town
There's still a rope burn on that old branch
That hangs over the river, I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallowed ground
That we ain't laughed or cried on, it's where we loved
Lived and learned a lotta stuff
It's everything we're made of
It sure left it's mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here, with everything we did
We laid a lotta memories down, like tattoo's on this town
Like tattoo's on this town
Everywhere, it's where we are
It gets me right, in my heart
It sure left it's mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here, with everything we did
We laid a lotta memories down
But we'll always be hangin' round, like tattoo's on this town
Like tattoo's on this town

There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
"Allie, will you marry me?"

Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town

There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart

It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And we'll always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town
I was born across the river
In the mountains where I call home
Lord, times were good there
Don't know why I ever roamed
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band
Me and my woman's done made our plans
On the Tennessee River, walkin' hand in hand
Gonna raise a famly, Lord, settle down
Where peace and love can still be found
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We get together anytime we can
Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man
We play together in Mother Nature's band

Ohio was a riverbank
A ten speed layin' in the weeds
Cannonball off an old rope swing
Long, long summer days

Tennessee was a guitar
First big dream of mine
If I made it, yeah, that'd be just fine
I just wanted to play
I just wanted to play, but

Texas was green eyes crying goodbye
Was a long drive
A heartache I'm still trying to get through
Texas was you

Carolina was a black car
A big white number three
California was a yellow jeep
Cruisin' down Big Sur
Haha

Georgia was a summer job
'Bama was a spring break
I got memories all over the place
But only one still hurts
Only one still hurts like

Texas was green eyes crying goodbye
Was a long drive
A heartache I'm still trying to get through
Texas was you

Texas was my whole life waving goodbye
'Thought I'd die
A heartache I'm still trying to get through
Texas was you

It'll always be you

I found a box of memories
Read a letter dropped a tear where you signed your name
And turning the page smearing the ink and the love always
Girl I always start this way
Then I end up in a bottle screaming out your name
And punching the walls, carrying on like I've gone insane
In the mirror I can see the man that just shook his head with no remorse
Watched an angel crying tears packing all of her things as she walked out the door

Cause there arent nothing like a memory
When its coming on strong like a hurricane
How can love like that just up and walk away
Its killing me baby
Its got me pouring up another drink
Bourbons hitting me hard like a freight train
With my back against a wall or on my knees
When the worst of your memory gets the best of me

Well I remember it all too well
Riding 441 down to Milledgeville
Crossing the bridge as the sun set on Lake Sinclair
I couldnt wait to see your smile but all I saw was tears in your pretty eyes
That said it all, it was all downhill from there
And I remember you saying baby please dont give up on me
Ah but baby this stubborn man is going to lie in the bed he made


Whoa gets the best of me

I've been here a bunch of times
It all stats with the same old lines it's over baby it's over
Nothing about it ever feels good
It knocks you down just like it should
But it goes away it always goes away
Something about this time feels different
It's like I'm in a fight I'm about to lose

This might be the heartache that don't stop hurting
It just keeps working on me
It just keeps picking on me
And these might be the tears that keep on falling
They won't stop coming on down
They won't stop raining on down
And baby it's too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

Man I've tried to kill the pain by shooting whiskey through my brain
But it never works it only makes it worse
So tonight I'm here again throwing punches in the wind
At some memory that I can't even see
I know that I don't want to let it have me
But everytime it hits I feel the truth


Tomorrow I'll stand up again
And give it my best shot again
But tonight it sure feels like

These might be the tears that keep on falling
They won't stop coming on down
They won't stop raining on down
And baby it's too early to know for certain
But this might be the heartache that don't stop hurting

It just won't stop hurting

Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured thats how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain baking in the sun
Dont quit 'til the job gets done

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop 'til everythings gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know

That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you dont get nothing that you dont earn
Humble pride that I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it

Sun in our eyes backs to the fences
We didnt know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasnt thinking bout nothing but winning

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop 'til everythings gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know

Maybe theres another path that
Will get you there a little bit faster
But Im sticking with the one inside of me

Thats the only way I know
Dont stop 'til everythings gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I
Thats the only way I know
But dont stop 'til everythings gone
Straight ahead, never turn round
Dont back up, dont back down
Full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you dont show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you cant dig no more
Thats the only way I know

That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know

Tell them all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell them I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine

Just don't tell them I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell them anything you want to
Just don't tell them all the truth
Yeah, don't tell them all the truth

Tell them all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell them that I must be into something bad for me
Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell them I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy can

Just don't tell them I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell them anything you want to
Just don't tell them all the truth
Yeah, don't tell them all the truth

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie
And we both know that it ain't right
But if you ever loved me
Please have some mercy on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tell them anything you want to
Just don't tell them all the truth
Yeah, don't tell them all the truth
I still need you

Yeah, that's the truth
I still love you
Baby, that's the truth
Do you remember when we snuck out of the house at the stroke of midnight
I was waitin' 'round the block 'Cause your daddy would have killed me if he'd a seen me
You jumped in my ride, we made a beeline out of town
And I drove so fast, yeah I drove so fast
We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
That's the way a night should feel
That was such a long time ago yeah I'll never know how we made it
You're still that same wild child and I don't take your love for granted
So let's jump in my ride, make a beeline out of town
And do it all again yeah like back when
We were rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico you were kissing my neck, yeah you had me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
The way a night should feel
When you're all about me and I'm all about you
Baby right now all I want to do, let's go
Rollin' down an open road
With the top laid back and the stars all shining
Headed down to Mexico, keep kissing my neck 'cause it keeps me flying
Rockin' to the radio, you in that short crop tank top dressed to kill
One hand on you, one on the wheel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
The way a night should feel
Yeah, that's the way a night should feel
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
They don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this way
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
No, they don't know
They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
No, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't know
No, they don't know

I can't count the barns I've past
Painted red, white and black
See Rock city
And up ahead there's a turn
Take me right through Gatlinburg
I hear it's pretty
Maybe some other time
I can't slow down
Right across that state line
Right about now

Her hair's still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch
With a glass of iced tea
In my sweat shirt and her bare feet
This I got to see

If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
And her face and that love waiting on me
This I got to see, this I got to see

I can't wait to get to her
Man, I wish I were there already
She's the only thing that keeps
This world from driving me crazy
I just hit that city limit
Yeah and that a pretty good sign
If I pick it up a bit
I'll be right on time


If I hurry I can catch
The colors on her skin from that sunset
And her face and that love waiting on me
This I got to see, this I got to see, yeah



Got us a sunset sinking into a Friday night
Got us some beer needs drinking hey and we just might
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go
But laying low is not all that goes on around here

It might look a little laid back to you
But it is not all just porches and plows
But do not let that one red light fool you
There is always something going down
In this nothin' town

That old abandoned factory just got the wrecking ball
We threw a party in the parking lot just to watch it fall
Sometimes we got to make it up as we go
But laying low is not all that goes on round here


Somebodys backyard
Some river bank
Sometimes come on you all
Yeah that is all it takes


There is something going down
In this nothin' town
There's a moment I can see
I close my eyes from this window seat
It's you and me under a midnight sky
Leaning on your car in the parking lot
Wish I could go back to that spot
The second right before we said goodbye
But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there
I wish there were runway lights
Where they could land this thing tonight
You'd be right there waiting at the gate
And I would stop you just before
You're reaching for that drivers door
If yesterday could be today
But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there
She's down there somewhere
If I could go back there
But this plane don't go there
This plane can't take me back in time
I could go anywhere
But I can't go back to that night
If I could, I would, I swear
But this plane don't go there
No, this plane don't go there
You ain't got a dress that I don't like
You ain't got a pair of jeans that don't fit you just right
There's not a minute in the day
That you don't knock me out, you don't blow me away
But girl, now that the sun is going down
Looking at you right and now, baby
Somethin' about that southern sky sitting back behind that blur
It goes perfect with your eyes
Girl, tonight looks good on you
It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars go round on you

Tonight looks good on you

Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss

But let me tell you right now
Baby, you're the only one
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleeping in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, living my life too fast
I've been making a living, not making a life
And knowing that now, well it cuts like a knife
The way it's been ain't how it's gonna be
Baby, starting right now, gonna give you the best of me
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't wanna take a long way home
Sleeping in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, living my life too fast
Ooh, I've been a rolling stone
I think it's time for me to roll on home
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleeping in a roadside room alone
Head in the clouds, foot on the gas, living my life too fast
Living my life too fast
I thought you were just being a girl
The kind that just wants to change me
Likes to find all my flaws
Thought I had you figured out
I told myself she's crazy
Man, was I ever wrong
The whole time you were just trying to love me
I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me
Didn't think those tears were real
Thought you were just trying to play me
I just stood there and let em fall
You were just loving me after all
I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, I can't believe I never knew, I never knew
The whole time you were just trying
The whole time you were just trying
To love me
Trying to love me
I just spent three nights in a two-night town
Sun's comin up and Im just goin down
Am I ever gonna turn my life around
I just spend three nights in a two-night town
It was women, it was sinnin, it was alcohol
It was everything the bible says will make a man fall
And I didnt wanna little lord I wanted it all
It was women, it was sinnin, it was alcohol
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till its too late
I just spend three nights in a two night town
With a bunch of lost souls out tryna get found
Girl Ive been a little crazy since you walked out
So I just spend three nights in a two-night town
When am I, ever gonna learn to walk away
When the chips are down and the cards ain't fallin my way
Why do I always gotta stay to long till its too late
I just spend three nights in a two-night town
Suns comin up and Im just goin down
But baby this pain is still hangin around
I think Ill spend four nights in a two-night town

I make you laugh and tell you things
You start thinking this is more than what it really is
You are beginning to dream and maybe someday
You could be the angel that could make me change
But all I see is a storm that you will get lost in
Because if it feels this good when we are just talking

You should be walking away, walking away
As far as you can go, as fast as you can
You do not know it but you got to be walking away, walking away
From me baby
Instead of trying to save me
You got to be walking away

You are standing there, in your party dress
And there is no doubt about it darling I am impressed
But I see you and I know me
I would say right now that I am the last thing that you need
But girl do not get me wrong, I would sure love to do this
But somewhere in my heart I know the truth is
 

State champs white and blue
Yeah, I remember you
You sure had a hell of a view from way up there
High above the yellow pines
And first baptist "Jesus Saves" sign
I talked to you a million times
'Bout gettin' outta' here

Water tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, for way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home

How far did you think I'd get
When I pointed my wheels out west?
A little young and dumb I guess
Gotta learn somehow
Slowin' down and drivin' in
I can finally breathe again
It's like I found a long lost friend
God I've missed this town

Water tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home

You and that lonesome full moon watching over me
I'm right where I'm supposed to be

Water tower, it sure is good to see you
I've been away, way too long
Water tower like a lighthouse in a storm
You help me find my way back home
You help me find my way

Counting the lines on a highway road
Mile one by one
Flying through the midnight rain
Like a bullet from a gun
I lay down but I can't sleep
Because I still feel the band
Still on a high from the crowd in the lights
With a cold one in my hand

Singing
Here I go, down this road
Another town, another state
I wouldn't have it any other way
All I want, is to sing my songs
Hearing that crowd, keeps me going
Guitars are rocking, wheels rolling

I step up, the lights go down
I hear that first chord ring
It's where I go to lose myself
Forget about everything
It'w my home away from home
Hanging with my friends
It's a crazy life, but every night
I get to do it again and again and again
 

Here I go
On down this road
Do not you know?
I would not have it any other way

Some days it's tough just getting up
Throwing on these boots and making that climb
Some days I would rather be a no-show or lay low
Before I go out of my mind

But when she says baby
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

Some nights I come home fighting mad
Feel like running my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fighting for anymore
Feeling torn, aw, to hell with it all

But when she says baby
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby

Everything gonna be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life

Yeah, she's the perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Something I can believe in, a best friend
A heaven sent love to lean on

But when she says baby
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't going nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair and saves me
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby

Yeah, that look in her eye's got me coming alive
And driving me a good kind of crazy
I gotta get to you baby, I gotta get to you now
Without you I'm going crazy, without you girl I'm going wild
The only thing that I wanna do is fall into you
Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down 
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
A day can feel like forever, baby when you're not around
Yeah when we ain't together, you're all I dream about
I'm turning corners I'm driving, over to your house
Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down 
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
The only thing that I wanna do, is fall into you
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
I wanna hear that want you sound
On your lips when I lay you down 
I wanna love you 'til there's nothing left
All night until the sky turns red
Do everything that we ain't done yet
But we been thinkin' about
Baby when the lights go out
Baby when the lights go out
I can twist the top off a 12-pack of longnecks
Get my redneck on baby all night long with the boys
And never even think about you
I can be sittin' with someone new at a table for two
Buzzin' on a bottle of wine and your memory
Ain't messin' up my good time
But when I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up
Every sip I take I can taste your kiss
I feel the fire of your fingertips on my skin
I guess that's why every now and then
I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up
It's a straight shot back to me and you
Yeah when I pour one up
I know just what I'm getting into
When I get whiskey'd up, that wantin' you again
Starts kickin' back in and I'm late night calling you up
My heart starts hurtin' when that bourbon starts burning
And I can't help but touch that stuff
It's just like you all warm and smooth
Even though I know that you don't miss me
It's like you're here with me
When I get whiskey'd up
When I'm all whiskey'd up

I don't think of you every day and night
I got things to do, yeah I'm doing alright
So, I can't explain why in times like these
I nearly go insane when you're not here with me

Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't help but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?

Oh it's the jealousy that's hurting me
So why can't I let it be, why can't I just let go?
But the thought of you somewhere with someone else
Doing what we used to do, feeling what we felt

Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't help but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't help but wonder
Who's kissing you...
Who's kissing you tonight?

Who's holding you tight? Aw, Who's kissing you tonight?

It is 3 AM and I finally say
I am sorry for acting that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh baby, sometimes I wonder why

Why does it always have to come down
To you leaving
Before I say 'I love you'
Why do I always use the words
That cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you
Oh baby why, do I do that to you

I know I would never let you walk away
So why do I push you till you break
And why are you always on the verge of good-bye
Before I will show you how I really feel inside


Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you
Oh baby why, do I do that to you
Why do I do that to you

The corner cafe
She scrapes some quarters off the table
Says thanks yeah now maybe I'll be able
To get that black Mercedes
I've been saving for
The other girls say
You outta undue a couple buttons
Start showing off a little something
She says now you go ahead
Think I'd rather stay poor
See I'm just making rent
She said this arent where my road ends

This may not be my town
It'll do for now
Till I can figure out
Who I am
Where I'm going
Shes slinging eggs and bacon
With a college education
Just hanging out and waiting
For a better plan
Shes ok not knowing
Shes young
And the worlds wide open

There's a rusty old ford
Lives out back behind the diner
Sitting there waiting on her to make her mind up
It tends to sling a little gravel
And take her who knows where
Maybe head out west
It's in Gods hands I guess


She throws down that apron
Takes the money shes been making
Her life's out there waiting
Got a better plan
That's where shes going
Shes young
And the worlds wide open

I have always been there every time he let you down
I caught your falling tears before they hit the ground
But I just heard somebody say that you finally told him goodbye
Well, girl now you have finally made your move, now I am here to make mine

I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there is no mistaking
You are the love I want to be in, oh yeah

I've kept my feelings under lock and key
Could not let you see them even though it was killing me
You can't imagine all the time I spent wishing you were mine
I just know if we ever kissed, we would go crazy, baby, for the rest of our lives

I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there is no mistaking
You are the love I want to be in
I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there is no mistaking
You are the love I want to be in
I want to be there when you wake up
Be more than just your friend
Baby there is no mistaking
You are the love I want to be in
You are the love I want to be in

I want to be there when you wake up

Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand

Night sand felt good on sunburned feet
Sitting on pool chairs we drug to the beach
But that salty air was bittersweet
Waiting for the sun to rise
Best friends talking 'bout the memories we made
We couldn't believe that we were graduating
The wind and the waves were slipping away but that moment felt so alive

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck
Splash in my cup, it'd never get old
One little sip, just a taste on my lip
I'd be taking a trip, wherever I go
I'd keep a life's good, sweet bliss
'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz
If I could bottle it up
If I could bottle it up

Well the year me, and my grandad fixed that car
It was a summer full of grease and changing parts
But when we finally got that thing to start
Man, it sounded just right
Riding with the prettiest girl I know
Breaking in a brand new record on an old back road
When that first slow love song came on
She couldn't hide that little smile

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck
Splash in my cup, it'd never get old
One little sip, just a taste on my lip
I'd be taking a trip, wherever I go
I'd keep a life's good, sweet bliss
'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz
If I could bottle it up
If I could bottle it up

And I'd drink it down
And I'd pass it around, pass it around
Cause it'll sneak up on you fast
When life pours out the good stuff
Just can't make it last
That moment in time would never end
Cause I'd take it with me when it did

If I could bottle it up I'd have a stash in the truck
Splash in my cup, it'd never get old
One little sip, just a taste on my lip
I'd be taking a trip, wherever I go
I'd keep a life's good, sweet bliss
'Does it ever really get better than this?' kinda buzz
If I could bottle it up
If I could bottle it up, If I could bottle it up

I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, "... that guy!" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town

I turn the TV off to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

You can say were done the way you always do
Its easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know theyre gonna say
Were bad for each other, but we aint good for anyone else

I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We dont have to miss each other, come over
We dont have to fix each other, come over
We dont have to say forever, come over
You dont have to stay forever, come over

I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Grab your keys, climb in your car
Put your headlights in my yard
Pull up the drive, put it in park
Walk inside, underneath my stars
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting
Don't say a word, don't say a word
Come over
I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound
I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
You can say were done the way you always do
Its easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know theyre gonna say
Were bad for each other, but we aint good for anyone else
I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care

We dont have to miss each other, come over
We dont have to fix each other, come over
We dont have to say forever, come over
You dont have to stay forever, come over
I told you I wouldnt call, I told you I wouldnt care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I dont think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over ohhhh
I grab your key, I'm in your car
With your headlights in my yard
Pull up the drive, put it in park
Walk inside, underneath my stars
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting
Don't say a word, don't say a word
Come over

We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man, they weren't playin'
They sure put those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

But there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

And you were like 
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

Cause there was somethin' 'bout the way
The blue lights were shinin'
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
But you were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back the back the cop car

I fell in love in the back of a cop car 

Oh, I drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Go for more and I don't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this

Im sorry I named the album Montevallo
And Im sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
Im sorry you cant listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And youve got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
To these songs you gave to me
'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMA's with me
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk
Barely holdin' on, on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me

Drinkin too much, drinkin too much
Since you been gone, I cant get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin too much, drinkin too much
Since you been gone, I cant get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

A year ago I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever OK to lie
Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water, and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone
Singin' these songs are just something to do
Every dream I ever had was you
Hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind you can't fall out of

Drinkin too much, drinkin too much
Since you been gone, I cant get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin too much, drinkin too much
Since you been gone, I cant get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm going down
I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around

I know this might seem like a contradiction
The last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number, and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen

Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gonna say to you
But I know there ain't no way, I know there ain't no way
No there ain't no way we're through

Well there ain't enough smoke in my eyes
To hide the kind of games you're trying to play
Honey, don't you act so surprised
You know exactly what I'm bout to say
You kiss my lips like you mean it, but you ain't that slick

Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down

And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see

So that's why when I pick you up
You always want me to drive your car
So I can leave mine at your house
And he can wonder where you are
Well, you're right here looking sexy, whispering in my ear

Everywhere we go, you keep looking around
Fixing your make-up like it's about to go down

And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
You don't want me, you just want your ex to see, ex to see

Girl, you look kind of cute called out
You're making it hard to have hard feelings for you now
So hey, did he really do you wrong?
I guess I can play along, I guess I can play along

And he walks in, it all makes sense
Suddenly you're climbing all up next to me, next to me
I ain't no fool, you rascal you
Girl come here and kiss me, I just want your ex to see
I just want your ex to see, ext to see, ex to see

I just want your ex to see
Girl, you look kind of cute called out
I just, I just, I just want your ex to see
I just want your ex, I just want your ex
I-I just want your ex, I just want your ex to see

Never seen such a beautiful straight face
I never questioned anything
You sealed my lips and you stole my shirt
Tattooed my heart but mark my words
What do you call the other half of half the truth?
What I didnt know never hurt you
You shouldve paid up front when you sold me out
I lost so much sleep but its over now

Our love is lying there
Lying by your side
Murdered by the lies you told now youre the one who cry
And your tears rain down
Rain down your face
And falling on the pillows in the bed you made
You left me nothing now its all Ive got for you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You kissed my mouth in brand new places
Filled your camera with our faces
Wrote love letters underneath my name
Crawled in my arms every time it rained
But all those memories Im burning em babe
Cant you see this aint no maybe
You went and threw them all away somehow
What felt right then I cant feel right now

Our love is lying there
Lying by your side
Murdered by the lies you told now youre the one who cry
And your tears rain down
Rain down your face
And falling on the pillows in the bed you made
You left me nothing now its all Ive got for you
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Oh, you left me nothing now its all Ive got
You left me nothing now its all Ive got
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I wanna wrap you up in summertime and innocence
Like a curfew kid's goodnight
And going make you wanna sneak off and get away with me
Like a stolen Marlboro Light
Pick you up and drive you around
If you're mad
Jack it when the sun goes down
And I'll fight for you in the parking lot
Tattoo your lips across my heart
Maybe we can
Drift off in a glory daydream
Cause baby
Here in the real world it's so hard to believe in love
Jaded hopes and faith, dreams ain't part of growing up
Life ain't trying to make you older than you are
I wanna make you feel like you got a high school heart
Don't get tired
High school heart
Edge of desire
High school heart
So on fire

You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe
Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
We can drag a little time
You can spend some of my money maybe waste a little wine
We could go to the beach
We could watch TV
We could write our names on the bridge or just listen to the radio
Breakin' to that old hotel
We can get a kickback ourselves
We can call the whole damn crew
It really don't matter whatever you wanna do
I'm down
If you wanna head back to town
If you wanna just drive aro-o-ound
If you wanna get flirty
If you wanna talk dirty
I'm down
If you wanna come a little unwind
Whenever you just wanna hang o-o-out
Wherever you're up for
Baby girl, I'm down

She dont laugh at everything, but when she does the planets swing around her
She dont step on sidewalk seams, her teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She dont need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a tilt-o-whirl

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

The sunrise waits for her to wake up
Shes a pony tail, no makeup Saturday
She dont need umbrellas in the summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jeans and pearls

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world

She turned around and it felt like the street turned upside down
The only thing that I could say was, "hey"
And Im just glad she didnt walk away

I met a girl
She made me smile
She made me wait
She crossed the street
She crossed my heart
She fixed her dress
She bit her lip
She lit me up
I met a girl with crazy shoes and baby blues
The way she moves is changing my whole world
I met a girl

I met a girl
I met a girl
I met a girl

They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot and the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
Woah, woah
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Woah, woah
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me

Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me

Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me

Snapbacks and Levi jeans
PBR and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
We're still working on our summer feet
Cheap gas and Reddy ice
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
A pretty girl and a pickup line like
"Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty, baby"

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it 
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck
5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it 
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

We stayed up all night long, made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water in the middle of the night
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in, stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it 
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Mmm yeah
When that sun starts sinking
When they turn those open signs around
We thought we ran this town
Running around just
Breaking hearts and curfew
Out in the yard with no shoes
Staying cool in a Nylon pool
Foul ball headed for the parking lot
And those Saturday mornings we sleep late
ATVs and fire breaks
Worn out jeans, black eyed peas, backroads and blue skies
I was born and raised on it
Might have misbehaved on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made
Ever, you know  baby
Yeah, baby
I'm broke for my baby
It's been a long week
Feels like two
Can't afford to unwind
Can't afford not to
We're going out
Go raid your closet and your top drawer
We're going out
Tie your hair up pretty
Leave the hangers on the floor
It's Saturday night
And the city never sleeps
It's Saturday night
Baby why should we
I got a clean t-shirt and a shot of cologne
We're way too young to be sitting at home on
Saturday night
It's Saturday night
Windows down in the taxi
I think this cabbie's insane
We're singing in the backseat
Hey brother keep the change
We're going out
I got a good time that I wanna show you honey
We're going out
Till we unfold all my folded money

It's Saturday night
And the city never sleeps
It's Saturday night
Baby why should we
I got a clean t-shirt and a shot of cologne
We're way too young to be sitting at home on
Saturday night
It's Saturday night


Hey
It's Saturday night
And girl wow you look as good as you did walking out of the house
We danced until your feet hurt
Got your hair down high heels hanging out of your purse
Out on the curb
I'm thumbing a ride and climbing in first
So you can climb in my lap
Laughing and acting a fool
In the back of the cab
With the same old
Dude with the fu manchu
And the cool tattoo with his pants pulled up and the cash in his shoe
No thanks no change
That's cool I'm cool
Don't mind if I do girl after you
We're crashing the pool at the holiday inn
They're kicking us out
We're calling your friends

Whatcha wanna do now love
Whatcha say baby
If the sun still ain't up
Then it still ain't Sunday
It's Saturday night

And the city never sleeps
It's Saturday night
Baby why should we
I got a clean t-shirt and a shot of cologne
We're way too young to be sitting at home on
Saturday night
Its Saturday night
Hey eh
Hey eh
Hey eh
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

The new year's getting older, the February roses are withered away
The sun keeps getting closer, sinking a little slower everyday
Ooh, it's getting louder at the lights, music clashing in the street
Moon shining on the parking lot dolls
Tanned legs in the nights, sliding out of the seat
Stilettos at the crosswalk

I graduated, but every year in May, I get that school's out feeling
I feel it creeping in
Every day's a weekend and I'm drowning in the freedom

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I loved her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

I've gone off the deep end, company I'm keeping is messing me up
The good girls at home sleeping while I'm out creeping 'til the sun comes up
Ooh, Ive got my phone faced down and my hair combed back, riding round, getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls, holding hands and forgetting their names

I graduated, but every year in May, I get that school's out feeling
Don't wanna leave here, but damn it, I'm not a cheater and I can't help leaving

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

All of these pretty young things 
Can make you forget a goodbye set
Try to make a good guy bad

Blame it on the bikinis, party girls, and martinis and the sunshine
The private school daughters that never go under water, keeping their hair just right
I know in September, I'm gon' remember how much I love her
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer
I'm single for the suh-uh-uh, single for the summer

Why do I love all of these city girls?
Why do I love all of these city girls?
Why do I love all of these city girls with pretty eyes?
Down on Demonbreun and broken hearted rich girls, the debutantes, the small town runaways
All dolled up at the bar, with debit cards, they dont know how pretty they are
City girls, city girls

I softly kiss your neck, and slowly whisper
You breathe in cause it feels cold where my lips were
T-shirt for a pillow, music up real low, creeping through the window
I can feel the bass line in the bed liner, and your heart on mine
Tryin' to jump up out of your chest

Baby you're now on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

The moonlights tracing those tree tops across your face
There's a feeling in your eyes the shadows can't erase
The cool wind around us is breezing around us
Following my fingers through your hair
The engine is idling and girl this heat lightning is flashing
Pictures of you and burning them in my head

And I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, wrapped up in the stars
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods no body for miles
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

I'm tuned in to you, something's on your mind, ain't it?
Go on and tell me baby, don't act like you can't say it
I know your body language, you ain't gotta translate it
Let it talk to me, till I can't take it
Your lips, your hair, your smile, your touch, your kiss, your stare
Your vibes too much
It lights me up, you got me set
I'm way too gone, so baby let your eyes close
Say my name and watch me goin' up in flames

Girl I'm on fire, girl you're on fire
Out in the dark, where the wild things are
So right, girl I'm so high
You and me, wild and free
Way out in the woods parked under the pines
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on
Love in the back of the truck with the tailgate down
Just us and the speakers on

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

No watch
No phone
No shoes
Got on a pair of cheap shades I'm probably gonna lose
Dug a hole in the sand with some kid's toy
Now I'm kicking back in it like a lazy boy
Got the radio right
I'm lounging hard
Take a picture of me, put it on a postcard

Hey, I'm on vacation
I might not go back home
Ain't got no static on my reggae station
I'm here
I'm gone
I'm on vacation

That parasailing don't look all that hard
That ain't nothing but fly fishing for sharks
Running on the beach is for the seabirds
Say that for these overachievers
I just sit right here on the breeze
Excuse me honey, can you get my shoulders please?

Hey, I'm on vacation
I might not go back home
Ain't got no static on my reggae station
I'm here
I'm gone
I'm on vacation

Sitting by my swimming pool
Eating lobster tail in my swimming suit
Right here holding me down, down by the ocean
You can find me somewhere in slow motion, slow motion

Hey, I'm on vacation
I might not go back home
Ain't got no static on my reggae station
I'm here
I'm gone
I'm on
I'm on vacation

Lipstick graffiti on the bathroom mirror
What happened to me still ain't clear
You came and went like a thief in the night
Left your mark on everything in sight
Well I got some earring evidence
The eye liner notes you went and hid
I know exactly who let you in
And right where I could find your fingerprints

Girl, I guess I should have known
You look like a little hoodlumwith my hoodie on
Dancing on my bed to a Fugee song
Just killing me softly

Girl, you're a vandalizer, little hypnotizer
You left me laying here with my eyes closed
Stole my heart with a kiss right under my nose
Little love crook, don't know how much you took
But you ransacked my drawers, cluttered up my floors
And made a mess of me, you made a mess of me

Now before you showed up, I had it all together
Now I'm picking up and putting back all of my records
This dull razor won't shave my face
There's bobby pins all over the place
Well the smell of your hair put a spell on me
Tangled up in a chair, I could feel you breath
Now thinking about it's all I could do
I can't wait to get my hands on you

You're a vandalizer, hypnotizer
You left me laying here with my eyes closed
Stole my heart with a kiss right under my nose
You're a love crook, I don't know how much you took
But you ransacked my drawers, cluttered up my floors
And made a mess of me, you made a mess of me

Come on back
Come on back
Girl, come on back
Ohhhh Ohh Ohhhh

Girl, I guess I should have known
You look like a little hoodlum with my hoodie on
Dancing on my bed to a Fugee song
Just killing me softly

Summer coming through the rolled down window
Tearin' down an almost two lane backroad
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young
Never gonna get old
Living for the day
Like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves
The tires in the grass
Stayin' on the gas like we're never coming back

It's a Friday night
It's a small town, girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything

Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

Swingin' back and forth
Can't you feel the music?
Time stands still
And I don't wanna lose it
Her tan
Her touch
Her laugh
We're flying so high like we're never gonna crash

It's a Friday night
It's a small town, girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything

Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

We are tonight
We are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dreaming as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

It's a Friday night
It's a small town, girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything

Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight
Summer coming through the rolled down window
Tearin' down an almost two lane backroad
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young
Never gonna get old
Living for the day
Like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves
The tires in the grass
Stayin' on the gas like we're never coming back
It's a Friday night
It's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back, beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks, singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything
Whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight
Swingin' back and forth
Can't you feel the music?
Time stands still
I don't wanna lose it
Her tan
Her touch
Her laugh
We're flying so high like we're never gonna crash
It's a Friday night
It's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back, beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks, singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything
Whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are tonight
We are tonight
Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dreaming as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight
It's a Friday night
It's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back, beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks, singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything
Whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight
We are tonight
We are tonight
Put your fist to the wall
Say you through it all
Baby I'm through too
Just throw a log on the fire of the heat of the moment
Put your key in the car
Jerk it right outta park
Flip a big air fume
That's when your tires on a gravel and throw it cause
I know you love me
When you hate me
Baby I ain't gonna let it faze me
Right now we're just a circus leaving town
We'll come back around
It's ain't the worst we've seen
Ain't the first bad dream
Ain't the third world war
Every once in a while we just gotta get a fight on
You say you won't come back
I say amen to that
And I lock that door
But I know you got the key and I'm gonna leave the light on
Know I love you
When I hate you
You show up girl you know I'm gonna take it
Baby even the moon and the sun got their ups and downs
We'll come back around
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
When the winds and the rain are gone
Both be sorry even if it don't get sick
No matter how old and we are
We never get too far from not back in this bed
Know you love me
When you hate me
Baby I ain't gonna let it faze me
Right now we're a pair of hearts and the chips are down
We'll come back around
Know I love you
When I hate you
You show up girl you know I'm gonna take it
We're just a couple of kids on a merry go round
We'll come back around
I don't know what it was about her 'cause she's still all my mind
So why wouldn't I could keep her but waiting here is just fine
'Cause I know someday, she'll come my way
And soon the sun will shine
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And if I'm going to save all my love
I'd save it for the day she comes back
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And she can wrap the world in a river's mate
The stars are string of pearls
With the colors of the sunset, she takes me round the world
Now every night, inside of 
I am sending her my love out there
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
And if I'm going to save all my love
I'd save it for the day she comes back
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
Though I know she's gone
Maybe dreams just can't be wrong
'Cause no one else on Earth
That makes me feel, the way I feel with her
And if I ever lose my heart

I'd lose it to a girl like that

And if I'm going to save all my love
I'd save it for the day she comes back
And if I ever lose my heart, I'd lose it to a girl like that
Yeah, if I ever lose me heart
I would lose it to a girl like, a girl like that

The cards are stacking up against us
These days our luck is running low
It's hard to explain but a little bit of rain
Seems to follow us wherever we go

Black cat sitting' on a ladder
Broken mirror on the wall
We're not a bit superstitious
No need to worry at all

'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone
This world can be tough
But I know when our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own, luck of our own

The storm is only temporary
But you and I are here to stay
Baby can't you see true love is all we need
So just throw that rabbit's foot away

'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone
This world can be tough
But I know when our love is this strong
We can make a little luck of our own
Oh we can make it baby


We can make a little luck of our own
Yeah, yeah
Oh we can make it baby
Make a little luck of our own

Last night I fell asleep, and I saw you dancing in my dreams
Just like the way the Autumn leaves fall for you
All for you
You changed my life, you changed my ways
I don't even recognize myself these days
It must be a reflection of you
Only you

I can't remember feeling love like this in so long
I can't imagine living life without you by my side
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry
It's so true, I'm all for you

My arms could hold you tight, keep you warm in the coldest night
My hand would pull your hair right back away from your eyes
For you. Only you
If I knew how to do it
I'd paint the moon, the stars around you
Paint the perfect sunset
But I couldn't make it more beautiful than you
Oh, nothing compares to you
You know it's true
 

Some might call it insanity
Without a doubt for the rest of my life
I'm going to be crazy
Baby, crazy for you
All for you
I'm all for you
Oh, I love to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
I love to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
And I love to ate, ate, ate epples and banenes
I like to ate, ate, ate epples and banenes
And I like to eat, eat, eat eepples and baneenees
I like to eat, eat, eat eepples and baneenees
Well, I like to ite, ite, ite ipples and baninis
I like to ite, ite, ite ipples and baninis
Well, I like to ote, ote, ote, opples and banonos
I like to ote, ote, ote, opples and banonos
And I like to ute, ute, ute upples and banunus
I like to ute, ute, ute upples and banunus
Well, as you've guessed, these are all the vowels
There's A, E, I, O and U
And now I need you to help me out
I need you to make a sound like a tuba
You can do it with your mouth
A tuba sounds like this, okay?
Then maybe we can add some percussion noises like this
Now we're gonna add some finger snaps and a hand clap like this
Excellent, now you're gotta repeat after me
A, E, I, c'mon I, O and U
All together
Well, I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas, everybody!
I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
Well, I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
The light shines down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary
She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into feel good
Oh how I wish I was lyin' in the arms of Mary
Chorus
Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone
When I learned all she had to show 
She really gave all a boy could take
So now when I get lonely
Still lookin for my one and only
That's when I wish was lyin' in
The Arms of Mary


Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're going to have
More than just the things that you need
We have not got much now, were just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming

Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's going to shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're going to fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

So hold on, hold on
Come on baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all
And ooh

Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

Oh, a better life
Hey we're going to leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're going to break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free
We're going to be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now baby

Oh oh oh
Uh uh uh
Yeah
Well I don't know why
It's taken so long to find
That someone who makes me feel like I'm already home
There's a feeling inside
Since you came into my life
And now I just want to give you every little thing you want

I can't help it
When I see your Face
I just want to make
Big promises
Yeah I can feel it
When I watch you sleep
I just want to keep big promises
Big Promises

Now it's a beautiful place
I'm finding I'm in these days
The dream that I kept to myself I got someone to share 
Yeah you're making it feel so good
Like I thought that it never could
And the crazy truth is, baby you got me loving like I never dared

I can't help it
When I see your Face
I just want to make
Big promises
Yeah I can feel it
When I watch you sleep
I just want to keep big promises

I want to give you a place where you know you're safe
In these arms I'll keep you warm
Because you've given me a life
So just look in my eyes and you'll know for sure
That my heart is yours, evermore 


Yeah, I can't help it honey
When I see your Face
 I just want to make
Big promises 
Yeah I can feel it
When I watch you sleep
I know I am going to keep big promises

Yes I know when I see your pretty little face
I'm going to do the best I can
To give you every little thing
That you'd ever need and I'am always be your man
In the middle of the night
For the rest of your life
I'll be forever true
I'll be loving you, loving you
Big promises
Billy left on Friday night with twenty dollars cash
Had a thousand more and a diamond on his hand
When he got back
I don't know just where Billy got that dough
Saturday he spent in style
Drinks were on the house
Lincoln here, and a Jackson there
Suspicions were aroused
A dime was dropped and a name was named
A body soon was found
A travelin' Bilble salesman
On his monthly trip to town
Three bullet holes
A .38 done took his soul
What do you know
No diamond ring, no money roll
A quick investigation
They dragged Billy to the station
And broke him down with the third degree
His alibi unraveled
Judge Riley banged his gavel
A 12-man jury all agreed
So he must be guilty
I knew Billy spent that night
Winning big at cards
And the salesman was a married man
Who broke my sisters heart
Billy sits in Levenworth
Waiting for the gas
And I know lots of other things
But no one ever asked
So they'll never know
Swear to God they'll never know
Case is closed, that's how
The story will be told...

I wore a black leather jacket way back in high school
And man, lookin back at these pictures of us, we were so cool
You were so hot in your pink lipstick
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight
You wore it in the stands at the football games
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl

And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

I know you grew up, I grew up, too
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too
Thank God they look like you

And every night I put it back it on and I'm sixteen sittin next to you
Down by the river if you get the shivers, I'll put it around you
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket

Well, there's nothing in the world makes me feel more alive
When its just you and me and the moon is high
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes
Two kids just fallin in love
And here we are right now, good heavens above
Its only gettin better, baby
Its only getting better, baby
I just love that black, leather jacket

I can...
See you over there starin' at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink, all alone tonight
And...
Chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right
Well, it's...
Probably not my place but I'm gonna say it anyway
Cause you look like
You...
Havent felt the fire, had a little fun
Hadnt had a smile in a little while, baby

That I just might

It's the weekend, and I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me
Oh 'cause I need to have you near me
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me

I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on

Hey I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on

Hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home
Maybe you will let me, buy a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Well, hello blue stranger, I haven't seen your around
But I know every reason, for leavin' town
We might know each other, before the night is through
I'm a blue stranger too
And strangers fall in love, all the time
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us, a little unsure, chattin' out hi's
Well, hello blue stranger, will you take a chance
Well I might be mistaken, but I see meaning in your glance
Maybe this could be the start of something new
I'm a blue stranger too

And strangers fall in love, everyday
All lovers were strangers once
Just like us, a little unsure of our little ways
Well, hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home
Maybe you will let me, buy you a round or two
I'm a blue stranger too
Hello blue stranger, Hello blue stranger
Hello blue stranger

It aint a story as old as time
Just as old as when they first
Rolled off the assembly line
Everybody knows how it goes
Once upon a time, four wheels rolled and a

Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
One night turns to love
Love turns into one knee down
Down payment on a 3 bedroom house
Filled with the sound of little feet
Then you blink and hes asking for the keys to pick her up
Boy gets a truck

Its freedom flying down a two-lane
Young love steaming up the windows
Cause it cant wait
She's whispering in your ear
While you're tryin to keep it on the road
Its been goin on for years

Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
One night turns to love
Love turns into one knee down
Down payment on a 3 bedroom house
Filled with the sound of little feet
Then you blink and hes asking for the keys to pick her up
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl

Yeah, shell slide on over
Put her head on your shoulder
While the wheels keep turnin the world
A boy gets a truck

Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
One night turns to love
Love turns into one knee down
Down payment on a 3 bedroom house
Filled with the sound of little feet
Then you blink and hes asking for the keys to pick her up
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one
Boy gets a truck, truck gets a girl
Girl gets a midnight feeling hes the one

There'll be days your heart don't wanna beat
You pray more than you breathe
And you just wanna fall to pieces
And nights, those 2 AM calls
Where dreams become walls
And you just need a break
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me


There'll be times when someone you know
Becomes someone you knew
But you'd do anything to change it
And words you wanna take back
But you know you can't
When the page just won't turn
And it still hurts
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me


Oh, when you need somebody
When you need somebody right now
You're where I'll be
Break on me

Shatter like glass
Come apart in my hands
Take as long as it takes, girl
Break on me
Put your head on my chest
Let me help you forget
When your heart needs to break
Just break on me

Break on me
Break on me, baby
Hmmmm

I can hear the neighbors
They're arguing' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shouting' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of you love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of you love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord I'd be lost

Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
I can hear the neighbors
They're arguin' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shoutin' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer
But for the grace of God, go I
I must of been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
I can see that old man
He's walkin' past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone, it never riings
He wanders through his empty home
Surrounded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do
But for the grace of God, go I
I must of been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of your love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God
Whoa, hmm
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracin' me
Oh, Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God, yeah
I'd be lost but for the grace of God, yeah
Ooh, woh...
It's been so long since you felt like you were loved
So what went wrong?
But do you know there's a place where you belong
Here in my arms?
When you feel like you're alone in your sadness
And it seems like no one in this whole world cares
And you wanna get away from the madness
You just call my name and I'll be there
You just call my name and I'll be there
The pain inside rest or hope for love
And soon you will find
That I'll give you all that your heart could ever want
And so much more
When you feel like you're alone in your sadness
And it seems like no one in this whole world cares
And you wanna get away from the madness
You just call my name and I'll be there
You just call my name and I'll be there
You just call my name and I'll be there
Just call my name
Call my name, say it now
I want you to never down
The love I have for you is so alive
The love I have for you is so alive
Oh, you just call my name
You just call my name

If there's sand that you ain't wrote your name in
If you're tired of the view from the same window
If there's lips that you wanna be drunk on
Ferris wheels that you need to get stuck on, go...
See everything you think you need to see
Then come back to me
If there's pavement you ain't put your shoes on
If there's dance floors you ain't made a move on yet
And if you're feelin' too safe here beside me
And you wanna do something you might regret
Try the whole world on if you feel the need
Then come back to me

I wouldn't want you to miss a thing
I wouldn't wake you from any dream you've ever had
So go on and go unroll every map
If you gotta leave, you gotta know
I love you enough to let you go
If there's greener grass--
Hey i wanna hold you, I don't want to hold you back

If you fly like a bird in the jet stream
Hope the sky is in Hollywood-set-scene blue
And if you land with a tan and your shades on
Hope the promise the postcard made comes true
But if ain't all that you dreamed it'd be...
Come back to me


If you find someone else who deserves you
Hope he loves you enough not to hurt you
But if he does you know right where I'll be...
Come back to me

We drove right past
That no trespassing sign
We sat on the tailgate
And watched the planes take off
We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That's when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain't this some shhhh

Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

Man, they weren't playing
They sure threw those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk 'em
They didn't fall for it
But I did
You were on the left
I was on the right
I knew you didn't smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

I swear your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Ohh, and you were like

Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

But there was something bout the way
The blue lights were shining
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
And you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

I fell in love in the back of a cop car
A side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked
And we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
I was already gone baby
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Songwriter:  Sam Hunt

Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
As the village children fight each other for their share
And the six-to-nine goes roaring past the creek
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort and a truck that's going back home
Oh it's going back home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
"Hey but that is not natural" old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day


Country comfort and a truck that's going back home
Whoa, it's going back home
Hey take me back home
And a truck, and a truck that's going back home
Any truck

I'm changing lanes
I'm talking on the phone
I'm driving way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with
Gunners like me afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're coming undone

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by

Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losing ourselves

Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
Yeah,it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by
Yeah, cause days go by

We think about tomorrow then it slips away
Oh, yes it does
We talk about forever but we've only got today

And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by

It's all we've been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Better start living right now

Cause days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind as the cars go by
Yeah,it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
Cause days go by
Yeah, cause days go by
So take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by

Come on, Come on now
Come on
Don't you know the days go by

It's killing me to write the word "goodbye"
I've wadded up and tossed a thousand tries
We both know the reason
There ain't nothing to explain
But I know that my leaving'
Will spare us both the pain

Desiree I can't hold you any longer
Desiree you love his money more than me
And the taxi's at the gate
I guess all that's left to say
Is in teardrops at the bottom of the page
"I love you Desiree"

It'd be easier to leave if I were mad
But it's hard to lose the best you'll ever have
And to write this note to you
Was the hardest thing to do
But not as hard as being' a poor boy
Who can't afford a girl like you


God, I love you Desiree
But I just can't take it anymore
I won't be around for your goodbye
I won't be around for your goodbye
You love his money more than me
I won't be around for your goodbye
You love his money more than me
I won't be around for your goodbye
Oh you love his money, you love it more than me
I was just a fool who couldn't see
That you love his money, you love it more than me
I've seen it happen too many times
And just where it starts I don't know
You're travelling steady but you don't see the signs
That tell you there's a fork in the road
And you don't think it's right but you're both turnin' away
And the ending is always the same
When suddenly parallel lives drift apart
And there's no one accepting the blame
But girl you and I we got too much too lose
By one of us saying goodbye
And I see it clearly we're both meant to be
But you got that look in your eyes
CHORUS:
Don't go, don't go
Cause you might regret everything
When you wake up on your own
Oh no, I'm not lettin' go
And I never will surrender what we got together
Layin' beside you I can't sleep at all
Wonderin' what your thinkin' inside
Will I wake up and find that
You've made up your mind to
Go it alone for awhile
And don't say it's present when it's all in the past
You gotta stop lookin' behind
And take everything as it comes for today is
The first day of the rest of your life
REPEAT CHORUS
Don't go, oh never say goodbye, Don't go
Oh no, you got that look in your eyes
I've seen it before, you're gonna walk out that door
REPEAT CHORUS 2x

Don't shut me out maybe baby
We should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby
They might be unfounded

Have a little faith you'll make it through
I'd never hesitate to talk to you
If you tell me just what's weighing on your mind
Maybe it could help you sleep tonight
So don't shut me out

Don't be so proud don't ya know that
Before a fall it leaves ya
And it'll take you down baby that ain't
Where I wanna see ya

The sun'll rise tomorrow come what may
And you'll feel better than you do today
And in time you'll cry no more
I know 'cause my heart's been there before

And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder's yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs and understanding friend around
So don't shut me out

Don't shut me out maybe baby
We should talk about it
'Cause you've got your doubts but maybe, baby
They might be unfounded
Listen to your heart and clear your mind
And you will find the answer every time
Every road you travel on will lead
To where it is your heart's supposed to be

And here I am when you need someone
My shoulder is yours to cry upon
And everybody now and then
Needs an understanding' friend around
So don't shut me out, don't shut me out, don't shut me out

I couldn't bring myself to take you home
I've got you out here all alone
And even this old drunken mind
Still right here tonight
Yellow fireflies in the field
Think I know the way I feel
Out the corner of my eye
Did you see that?

Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you

So make a wish and make it fast
I just want this thing to last
Cause heaven knows it's falling hard
And I'm not the only one

Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you

I never counted on your touch
Making me want you so much
I never dreamed that your sweet lips
Could make me feel like this
Nothing like this

Every star up in the sky
Has got your name on it tonight
And they don't stand a chance like I know I don't
And girl you can't tell me that you can't see
The kind of spell you put on me
You gotta know just what you do
Even the stars fall for you
Even the stars fall for you

So here you are now, nowhere to turn
It's just the same old yesterday
And you made a promise to yourself
That you were never going to be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on driving faster into the sun

Because everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes

Don't have to find your own way out
You got to voice, let it be heard
Just when it feels you're on a dead end road
There's always somewhere left to turn
So don't give up now
You're so close to a brand new day
Yes, you are and if you just can bear to be alone
I'll stay

Well, maybe I was too caught up to see
What you've been going through and all that I can say is
Oooo, yeah

And everybody needs somebody sometimes
Yeah, everybody needs somebody sometimes
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
A little left to save
Everybody needs somebody sometimes
Got to have someone beside you
Got to have someone beside you
Yes, you do, yes, you do
Everybody, everybody needs somebody sometimes

Figaro, figaro

Anytime that you want what you need
Close your eyes and say my name, call on me
And I'll be there for you no matter what they say, rain, hail or shine
I got my eyes right to the sky, waiting on your sign

Roll the dice and take a chance
A chance on me because you never can tell where a little bit of faith might lead
I got a you-shaped hole inside I swear gets deeper by the day
Flicking cigarettes out the window, going nowhere in this lonely rain

I need a faster car now
A rocket ship straight to the moon
I need a faster way to
Show you how much I need you, baby

It's a crime, it's a sin, it's a damn shame
But you're the cause and you're the cure of all my pain
There's never been a better fool for you, I can't believe my pride
Got me talking to an empty pillow in the middle of the night
I ain't slept in quite a while

I need a faster car now
A rocket ship straight to the moon
I need a faster way to
Show you how much I need you, baby
I need a faster car now
A rocket ship straight to the moon
I need a faster way to
Show you how much I need you, baby
I need a faster car now
I'm a rocket man in love with you
I need a faster way to
Show you how much you drive me crazy
Show you how much I need you, baby

And I need you, baby
And it's alright now

When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play saying you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Now is that how it works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

All I saw was smoke and fire
I didnt feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

Maybe you dont understand
I dont understand it all myself
But theres a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
Hes got a photograph
And theyre waiting for him back home
Its weighing on my mind
Im not trying to be a hero
I dont wanna die
But right now in this moment, you dont think twice

And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you
You dont think about right
You dont think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And Id do the same
For you
Yes I would
I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would
Id do it for you

I'm on a red dirt road winding up to a sky of blue
And I left the blacktop back about a mile or two
No more sitting' at home leave the T.V. and the telephone far behind
This life is killing' us all, back roads are looking' mighty fine
Oh, and...

Freedom's finally mine
I ain't talking' anymore
Yeah freedom's finally mine, It's finally mine
I ain't talking' anymore
Oh, freedom's finally mine

I'd like to throw out this cellular
And kick off these shop-shined shoes
Leave the kids at your mama's
And take off to Timbuktu
So give me two sets of mud-grip tracks
Lead-in' off to way out back o' yonder
There's no mountain I can't climb
To satisfy this need of mine to wander
Oh, 'cause...


There's no desert I can't cross
No river too wide
I can do what I want now
'Cause freedom's finally mine


Oh freedom oh freedom It's finally mine, yeah it's mine
It's finally mine, yeah it's mine
It's six Monday morning, she's back into her routine
Kicks off the covers, and thinks about last night's dream
Shower and coffee, she heads for the train
Thinkin' how every day's the same
There's gotta be more than a life on her own
All that she wants is a man to come home to
Chorus:
She's lookin' for someone to love her
And stay forever true
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too
She's lookin' for someone to hold her
Until the light of day
Somebody she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
Late in the evening she is dreamin' in black and white
An old love story she wishes portrayed her life
No one would know what goes on in her mind
Thinkin' it's only a matter of time
Til' someday she finds what she's lookin' for
And her ship'll come sailin' into her shore
Repeat chorus
She's lookin' for someone to love her 
And stay forever true 
Just somebody who she can believe in
And say they need her too 
She's lookin' for someone to hold her
Until the light of day 
Somebody she can make future plans with
And know he's here to stay
What kind of spell is this
That you've cast on me with your kiss
It's like i've lost all control of my senses
It's just not like me, to give in so easily
And dropping my thought and im leaving my heart defenseless
Oh, but im feelin good here beneath the pines of the Georgia woods
And what a surprise, hear by my side
It's more than a full moonshine and it's driving me crazy
I waited so long, something is strong
And now I gotta be fallin cuz im already callin you baby
Theres nobody hear to see
The sparks between you and me
We better be careful my love or these woods will be burning
Or maybe we just give in, throw caution to the wind
It's funny how we ain't got any say in the matter
And what a surprise, hear by my side
It's more than a full moonshine and it's driving me crazy
I waited so long, something is strong
And I gotta be fallin cuz im already callin you baby
Uh huh
Oh take me down town
Uh huh
Yeah, I waited so long, somethin is strong
And I know im falling cuz im already callin you
Oh
What a surprise, hear by your side
It's more than a full moonshine and it's driving me crazy
Oh waited so long, something is strong
And we know im fallin cuz im already callin you
Oh callin you baby
Yeah, uh huh

Moonlight, its gotta be close to midnight
Where did it go
All the time, all the friends left waiting
Never made it cause we kept making out
In the driveway, who wouldve thought in the driveway
That we would get lost
In that dashboard radio static
Makin our own kind of magic

Oooo, oh, I said, thirty more minutes, thirty minutes ago
Oooo, oh, but were still right here and you already know that

I should leave, put the car in drive babe
But your kiss keeps tellin me to stay
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way
You know we shouldve called it a night, babe
But goodbyes something I cant say
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way 

Windows, we already fogged up the windows
Were writing our names on the glass
As the clock keeps ticking
Sunll be up any minute

Oooo, oh, I said, thirty more minutes, thirty minutes ago
Oooo, oh, but were still right here and you already know that

I should leave, put the car in drive babe
But your kiss keeps tellin me to stay
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way
You know we shouldve called it a night, babe
But goodbyes something I cant say
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way 

Cause goodbyes something I, something I cant say
Yeah, your lips keep, keep
Gettin in the way

I should leave, put the car in drive babe
But your kiss keeps tellin me to stay
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way
You know we shouldve called it a night, babe
But goodbyes something I cant say
Yeah, your lips keep gettin in the way 
Gettin in the way
Something I, something I,something I can't say
Gettin in the way
Gettin in the way
But goodbyes something I cant say

Down the drain pipe cross the yard and through the fence
I risked a whooping every time I went
'Cause white boys weren't allowed
On the colored side of town
But I was proud to call
That old black man my friend
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on
I knew where my fingers went
From his greasy fingerprints
Yeah, he was passing on
What was handed down to him

And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart
Just like there's a ghost in this guitar
A ghost in this guitar

Well, the night before he died he made me take it
He said, "You play it now, 'cause I gotta go"
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it
'Cause sometimes I'm in control
And sometimes I just sit back
And let him go
Sit back and let him go


Take a listen to the ghost in this guitar

It never ceases to blow my mind
It does it to me everytime
Standing here looking at you
It makes me wonder what he was up to
Was he thinking about me
When he thought about you

When God made woman
He must've been proud
He must've been crying aloud
Or laughing out loud
Must've felt like the first time
Getting kissed by the sun
When God made woman

It must've been the most beautiful day
Looking down on all creation
He took a river that winds and turns
He took a fire that breathes and burns
And put it all in place
In the most perfect way
 

Let it go

Well I can't believe I'm sitting here today
Picking on my banjo with a big smile on my face
Writing new words to an old school melody
Hey there is no doubt that God's been good to me
Oh the sun is shining on down in Tennessee
And right now where I'm right where I want to be
I've never felt so loved, so peaceful and so free
Hey there is no doubt that God's been good to me

Because he put me smack dab in the middle of Paradise
In the heart of the city where my dreams have come alive
And everything I have, and everything I see
Is just another reminder that God's been good to me

This golden road's been long
And sometimes I have lost my way
I've been down some darkened detours
Leaning heavy on my faith
But where the devil had me chained
Lord your love done set me free
Hallelujah! God's been good to me
 
I can't fill up my car
It don't go near as far as it used to
And this home that I once nearly owned is getting hard to hold on to
And it weighs on my mind
Is my job on the line?
Will the lights stay on for another day?
Oh you keep me sane whenever I get this way
Cause the one thing I don't have to believe in in the middle of all this madness
Is when you take my hand, say I love you
Forget about all this sadness
And I thank god every day that you're my girl
Cause you make beautiful sense in this goin' crazy world
I turn CNN on and the war's going strong and it scares me
Guess I'm right where they want me to be, all afraid for my family
And I swear that it feels like I'm chained to a wheel and there's no one on earth that can save me
Then I see your face, then I'm touched by grace
Cause the one thing I don't have to believe in in the middle of all this madness
Is when you take my hand, say I need you
Forget about all this sadness
And I thank god every day that you're my girl
Cause you make beautiful sense in this goin' crazy world
Yeah, this goin crazy world
This goin crazy world

A child held up in the sky
To sunset youth, we say goodbye
But I wont live with regret
Carpe Diem is the secret
Cause, its....

Gone tomorrow, here today
I aint gonna waste it
I aint gonna waste it
No, its gone tomorrow
But its here today
I wont let it slip away

I feel the rush its kicking in
And I wish this night would never end
Were never coming back around
Like shooting stars, were burning out
Its...

Gone tomorrow, here today
I aint gonna waste it
I aint gonna waste it
No, its gone tomorrow
But its here today
I wont let it slip away

I wanna feel, wanna touch the light
I look around for the friends that have gone and Im
Reminded that its all just a fantasy
But we get to choose what we wanna believe
And I wanna believe that theres something more
Another level to the dream, right through the door
But right nows for real and its fading fast
Better live cause were never gonna to get it back

Its...
Gone tomorrow, here today
I said, its gone tomorrow but its here today
I wont let it slip away
Wont let it slip away
Wont let it slip away
Wont let it slip away
Wont let it slip away

Red sun in a lazy sky
Sitting on the end of my hood
Turning in a Friday night
Yeah, this is gonna be good
Here you come wearing that dress
Just like I hoped you would
A good, long I missed you kiss
Mmm, this is gonna be good

Your blue eyes, green in my pocket
Night is young, were gonna rock it

Oh, it's all starting to come together
Stars are lining up like they should
Yeah, like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good

I know a little hole in the wall
You wanna go, yeah, I thought you would
Well tear it up like a wrecking ball
Mmm, this is gonna be so good
My luck, it's your favorite band
And you dance like I knew you could
Well break it down to a nice, slow jam
Yeah, this is gonna be good

We've got a groove, we better lock it
Night is young, were gonna rock it


Oh, the night is young, we're gonna rock it
We're on a roll, we can't stop it


Oh, it's gonna be so good
Just like I pictured, but even better
It's gonna be you and me
And it's gonna be, yeah, it's gonna be good
Good morning beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day
I couldn't see the light, I didn't know
Day from night, I had no reason to care
But since you came along I can face the dawn
Cause I know you'll be there
Good morning beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day
I'll never worry if it's raining outside
'Cause in here with you girl, the sun always shines
Good morning beautiful, how was your night?
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I open my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day, yeah
A good morning beautiful day
Good morning beautiful, a beautiful day
Good morning beautiful, good morning beautiful
A beautiful day, good morning beautiful day
A beautiful day, good morning beautiful
Mmm, just hold it now, let me put my drink down
Baby, tell me are you really for real?
Swingin side-to-side, doin that electric slide
Spinnin' on your pretty little cowgirl boot heels
And you're all alone and that ain't right
A girl like you should have the best of everything
Like someone to treat you right
What I wouldn't give to hold you close
Longer than tonight
Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more
The possibilities, mmm, they're killin' me
Like you're killin' every dude in the room with the way you move
And you ain't slowin' down, my heads spinnin' round
But this neon buzz is a-gettin' me up and I wanna get down with you
Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
Just give me one chance and you'll never be lonely no more
Cause I know a good thing when I see it
And you got somethin' like I ain't never see before
Yeah, I know a sweet dream when I dream it
If you let me be your man you'll never be lonely no more
I hit the highway and I checked the time
I see the sunrise and it makes me wanna change my mind
Oh I got it bad
I stopped for coffee in a no where town
A pretty waitress says, hey what's the frown
Boy you've got it bad
Well so many times you told me before
If I don't like it, well there's the door
This time I've gone for good and I got it bad
CHORUS:
I got it badder than a broken heart
Badder than the Devil's smile
And I can't face bein' apart
I guess I'll have to leave but meanwhile
Oohh I got it bad
Moonlight on the water still looks the same
Pretty girl beside me but I don't know her name
Guess I got it bad
I'm too weak to say no, too lonely to care
I'll believe her if she says hey baby
I got love to spare
Well tomorrow I'll take it like a man
Tonight I'm takin' all I can
This time I went for good and I got it bad
CHORUS X 3

She believes in me like I've been trying to do
I'm seeing things I've never seen before
Ever since she came into my life
I've been a better man
Run, run running, I was running scared
Always looking for a place to leave
And I couldn't seem to find where I belonged
Till she took my hand

We can make this work out, baby
I know it's true
I can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
Oh, yeah

All of my life I've been looking for someone
Who believes in love the way I do
And I know I've made my share of big mistakes
But girl I promise you


True believers always find each other and here we are
Always knew that you were out there just waiting on me
For me to find my way, find my way to your heart
Oh, yeah


Yeah, after all the crazy days
Made it through
I can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time

Im no stranger to the love of a lowly vice
I drowned my liver and I gambled with my pride
Ive had a bad case of addicted phases
Moving from one to another
But you got me changing my ways
Im breaking all the habits Ive made

I could make a habit of you
Waking up in my bed
Staying up till two
Cause youre stuck in my head
Its a symphony you sing to me
When you call out my name
I dont know what else to do
But make a habit of you
Habit of you
Habit of you

Cut out the smokes and I stopped staying up all night
I quit checkin my phone and I'm savin my dimes
Cause its a wild thing but you got me jonesin
Need another taste of you
I dont think I could quit you now
Youre all that I can think about

I could make a habit of you
Waking up in my bed
Staying up till two
Cause youre stuck in my head
Its a symphony you sing to me
When you call out my name
I dont know what else to do
But make a habit of you
Habit of you
Habit of you

Alive
Something bout the look in your eyes
Can never get enough of this
High
Maybe Im an addict but I just gotta have it
I just gotta have you
Oh, its chemical, its physical, its spiritual
Its magical, its lyrical this high
Maybe Im an addict but I just gotta have it
I just gotta have you

I could make a habit of you
Waking up in my bed
Staying up till two
Cause youre stuck in my head
Its a symphony you sing to me
When you call out my name
I dont know what else to do
But make a habit of you
Habit of you
Habit of you

Habit of you

I had a heck of a time getting' into my house today
There was a big ass U-Haul trailer in my way
And she was headed for the car, so I grabbed my old guitar
I got one more chance before she drives away
So

Hank don't fail me now
You've always bailed me out
"Your Cheatin' Heart"
Could set that suitcase down
Give me one more song to whine
That'll make her change her mind
Cause she's walking out
Hank don't fail me now

Yeah she was throwing stuff cussing like a sailor at me
She was waving her arms around like she was fighting' bees
If I could yodel her a lick
That just might do the trick
If I sang "I Saw The Light" would she believe

So


She's walking out
Hank don't fail me now
She's walking out
Hank don't fail me now

I watched out the window
As you drove away
But we got so much history, baby
Too much good love to throw away

I know I can be a headstrong man
Got a jealous streak a country mile wide
Its just that I'm so damn scared of losing you
As you're fading out of sight

Ooh, oooh, I don't know why I do this every time
Ooh, oooh, run the other way from a heart like mine

I'm doing the same things
I saw my father do
Cause I was just a kid in the corner
Watching words as they turned black and blue

I'm the son of a son of a headstrong man
So defensive, so full of foolish pride
But I just will not lose you, baby
Oh, and I'm starting to realize

Ooh, oooh, I think I know why I do this every time
Ooh, oooh, run the other way from a heart like mine
Heart like mine

I know the love that we got is good
Can I be a better man, yeah, I know I could
Standing here in the middle of this moonlit road
I know just what I have to do

Ooh, ooooh, I'm runnin' to ya fast as I can tonight
Ooh, ooooh, gotta show you what its like, gotta show you what its like
To be loved, so loved by a heart like mine
Gonna wrap my arms around you as strong as young desire
Cause for you it's all beating in a heart like mine

Well if you ever said goodbye
I wouldn't waste all of my time crying
I wouldn't sit home alone wondering where I went wrong
I'd be rocking on out of here
Baby, faster than a rolling tear
Ain't no grass gonna grow under me when you're gone
No, I won't stay down for long

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I know exactly what I'd do, honey
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I'd hit the ground running after you

Yeah Woo

I'm gonna stop in
For a couple things I gotta pick up
Like some pretty red flowers and a store bought card
That say what I really feel
That I need yeah and I always will
And the three little words that used to come hard
Then I jump in back in my car and then

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I know exactly what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I'd hit the ground running after you
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
Hit the ground
Hit the ground running after you, yes, I would, woo

So if you gotta go baby, I won't stop you
And I won't sit around and miss you, no , no , no
Because if you leave I'm - a - coming with you
Coming with you, baby

I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I know exactly what I'd do, sugar
I'd hit the ground
I'd hit the ground running
I'd hit the ground running after you
There ain't no doubt, I ain't that proud
There ain't no doubt about what I'd do
I'd hit the ground
Monday morning, another workin' week ahead
Friday seems so far away
The clock keeps ringin', I gotta get up out of bed
Maybe this could be the day
Motivation, well it keeps you holdin' on
Every step of the way
Headin' in the right direction when you think you're turnin' wrong
Lookin' out for when you stray
So hear what I say
There's no other way, you gotta
Chorus:
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause everything ya see
Comes true if you believe in holdin'
On to your dreams
Well I know sometimes it's hard to see the light
Shinin' at the tunnel's end
And though the road just goes on and on for miles
Faith lives just around the bend
So now and then, remember
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
And everything ya see
Comes true if you believe in holdin'
On to your dreams
Just like your eyes are the window to the soul
Dreams are the highway that lead to your goal
Hold on, hold on
You've got to hold on
Hold on

Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause someday baby
Your ship is gonna come in, so
Hold onto your dreams
'Cause everything ya see
Comes true if you believe
In holding on to your dreams

You spun your web back a Sunday or two
I ain't never met nobody
Like the likes of you
You got me preaching' the news
You turned down my road and decided to stay
And I took a shine to your hair
And your hillbilly ways
And how you kiss on my face
I got a bone deep feeling'
You're the start of the good ole days

Well I still remember
You came by my trailer
With chicken and some homemade wine
The dogs got to barking'
When we got the sparkling'
We almost set the house on fire
Well I got a big heapin' helping'
Of the stuff I get a hankering' for
But honey your homespun love
Just keeps me coming' back for more

I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard
And I like the notions you stick in my head and my heart
Yeah and how you fix on my car
Well I reckon I'm lucky you're everything I need so far


So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend to say goodbye
You got your ticket, got your suitcase
You got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

Because I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
Though I try

We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
No, I saw you walk across the road
It may be the last time I don't know feeling humble
Heard a rumble on the railway tracks
And when I hear that whistle blow
I walked away and you won't know
That I was crying

Because I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
Though I try, I just can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
Why do I try, why do I try
Yeah

Time stands still for no one
I know this is true
I've been stuck here waiting
Then along came you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew

I want to thank you for the love that you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive
That I could fly
I could fly, oh

There's no way I could've made it this far
Without you
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe
That I could make it through
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew


Above the clouds
Fly so high, never come down
Just you and I, I'm so in love
With you, with you
And you gave me back
The love I had
The faith I'd lost
The life I knew
 

And I could fly, I could fly, oh
I want to spread my wings
Let me tell you
Said I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, and I need your love
Stay with me baby
Oh, I need your love, I need your love
Stay with me baby
Yeah I need your love, and I need your love
Stay with me honey baby, Come on now stay
Come on now, yeah

You and me side by side walking through the woods in the pale moonlight
Oh yeah now and it feels so good

I used to cry in the middle of the night
Baby hold me tight
There was nobody beside me when I opened my eyes
Now I've turned the color of those days and nights
Now something inside me changed and I think I might be starting over
I don't wanna run
Oh no, cause you might be the one, baby

If ever I could love, I think it could be with you
If ever I thought Id find somebody so true
I wonder if you feel the same way that I do
If ever I could love I think it could be with you

You know I can't read your mind my love but it seems to me
Your heart and mine tonight are defying gravity
Something' so familiar its still so unknown
The closer that I get I swear it feels like coming home
I ready to be brave
Oh yeah, When you look at me and say


If ever I could love, baby
If ever I could love
If ever I could love


I still never forget when the baby came and she walked out of my life
And got hurt so bad
I swore Id never let another get inside this heart of mine
But she touched my hand and everything plan I had disappeared like a falling star
Now there's a new beginning and I'm moving to the rhythm of a new and braver heart
A brave heart
If ever I could love, oh oh
If ever I could love, yea yea

Go if you wana go, stay if you wana stay
My hearts not a game you can play with and out away
Baby trying' to figure you out, could make a man go insane
So just go if you wana go, stay if you wana stay

Dream what you want to dream, be who you gotta be
I never wanna be the one who kept you from being free
But girl I gotta know what you want, 'cause I've taking all I can take
So just go if you wana go, stay if you wana stay

Every time you decide, to spread your wings and fly
You make the same mistake, and I can't take anymore goodbyes
So baby just go if you wana go, stay if you wana stay

I don't wana lose everything our love has made
But I don't wanna feel alone everytime you go away
So just go if you wana go, stay if you wana stay

Mmmm baby is just going if you wana go, stay if you wana stay

Love doesn't come with a contract
You give me this I gave you that
It's scary business
Your heart and soul is on the line
Baby why else would I be standing round here so tongue-tied

If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in, I'm in

Baby come on in the water's fine
I'll be right here you take your time
Just let me hold you and we'll both take that leap of faith
It's like I told you there's no guarantees when you feel this way

If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet
Silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
So if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in

Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am

If I knew what I was doing I'd be doing it right now
I would be the best damn poet's silver words out of my mouth
Well my words might not be magic
But they cut straight to the truth
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Now if you need a lover and a friend
Baby I'm in I'm in baby I'm in I'm in

Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
I'll breathe each breath you breathe I can pour out everything I am
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here next to me I'll show you how good it can be
Baby come here baby come here baby come here
Chorus:
I never work on a Sunday
I've got a life of my own
And this here is the one day
I spend with my family at home
I left the office in a flash on Friday
Threw my boots in the car
Cashed my pay cheque & headed for the country
To sleep underneath the stars
I drove all day Saturday and right into the evenin' 'till there were no more city lights
Those broken lines were gettin' blurry through my windscreen
Well I guess I drove all night
Then Sunday mornin' found me rollin' into sunrise
With my fuel gauge dead
I pulled into fill up, found the place deserted and a little sign that read...
Chorus
All I could do is call up a tow truck
To take me further down the road
I fumbled round & round for some change in my pocket
Walked fifteen minutes to the phone
There in the phone book I found a business ad-vert, saying "Use Us Instead"
I dialed the number and a tape recorder answered and it politely said...
Chorus
I finally got back home and it took forever
Then at work the next day
Somebody said
"Hey the boss said he wants to see you in his office right away"
He told me just how far behind the work was getting
And on the weekend could I stay
I started laughin' and said 'You must be kiddin'
I just got one thing to say... You know what I said...
Repeat chorus 2x
I'm quite entitled to one day
To spend with my family at home

I thought You knew, guess I assumed to much
I don't know how, but now we're so far out of touch
And I never planned, to so miss understand
But what you needed, you never asked me to give
And I swear as I live

I thought you knew my heart was yours
And that we were so together
That we, would always be
I don't believe, you leaving me is the answer

I'm not asking you to let me rush back in and fail again
I'm asking for one chance, not to assume
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew

So far we're still so far
From where we know we should be
I'm searching for words
And you haven't heard



I thought you knew
Oh god I thought you knew!

You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I to see you here tonight

Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

Sometimes in our lives
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is heading in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be


Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please

Oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling

Yeah, yeah
Ooh it's a love thing
I been working all day long
And I'm ready to come on home to you
All the other guys roll their eyes
And don't realize it's what I want to do
It's what I want to do
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand

Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah

Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
Yeah there's trouble in the world
But you're the girl
Whose open arms are all I really need
And that's why I come running'
To be there by your side
To let 'em call me crazy
But it can't be denied


And it's not about the same last name
It's not a thing that can be explained
It's how you make me feel inside
And the way you hold me everynight

It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah
He we go now
It's a love thing

They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand
Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
Come on it's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa
Oh sugar, it's a love thing
No it ain't about no diamond ring
It's a love thing, whoa
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing

You're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put a wedding ring on your finger
Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joining of our hearts is written in the stars
We've got a love made in heaven
So baby take my hand I wanna be your man forever

Well I can't think of anyone else it's true
All day long there's no one on my mind but you
And I have loved you since you were a little girl
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world


Every time I look into your eyes I see
The one I want beside me for eternity
You could make me the happiest man alive
By setting up a date and taking my name for life


Baby take my hand I wanna be your man forever

When I wake up in the morning light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
It's the weekend, and I know that you're free
So pull on your jeans and come on out with me
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me, I need to feel you close to me

You and me, we'll go motorbike riding in the sun
And the wind and the rain
I got money in my pocket, I got a tiger in my tank
And I'm king of the road again
I'll meet you in the usual place
You don't need a thing except your pretty face, alright
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
Aw, here we go mama

When I wake up in the morning light
I pull on my jeans and I feel all right
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on

I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on
I pull my blue jeans on, I pull my old blue jeans on

I'm a 45 spinning on an old Victrola
I'm a two-strike swinger, I'm a Pepsi Cola
I'm a blue jean quarterback saying "I love you" to the prom queen
In a Chevy
I'm John Wayne, Superman, California
I'm a Kris Kristofferson, Sunday morning
I'm a mama and daddy singing along to Don McLean
At the levee

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

Hey, hey
Everything I needed
That's right

I'm Mark Twain on the Mississippi
I'm Hemingway with a shot of whiskey
I'm a TV dinner on a tray trying to figure out the Wheel of Fortune
I'm a Texaco star, I'm a Gibson guitar
I'm still a teenage kid trying to go too far
I'm a jukebox waiting in a neon bar for a quarter

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Just another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16

I spent a lot of years running from believing
Looking for another way to save my soul
The longer I live, the more I see it
There's only one way home

And I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16
Oh, I'm a child of a backseat freedom, baptized by rock and roll
Marilyn Monroe and the Garden of Eden, never grow up, never grow old 
Another rebel in the great wide open on a boulevard of broken dreams
And I learned everything I needed to know from John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16


Everything I needed

Everything I needed

Oh, that's right

I heard the rumor that we're calling' it off
And we won't last too long
But I got this feeling' when I'm looking at you
Baby
They couldn't be more wrong
They've been saying' it's a shaky romance
And they don't give the two of us too much of a chance

But if the Grand Canyon is just some ditch
Dorothy and Toto fought just some witch
And if Babe Ruth was just a guy with a glove
Then oooh baby this is just some love
Oooh baby this is just some love

I speak my mind baby that's the truth
But you've got a temper too
So when they see us start to fuss and fight
I guess they think we're through
But if they're judging' us by what they see
Then they don't have a clue about you and me

'Cause if the Rocky Mountains are just some hills
Niagra Falls is just some water spills
And if Humphrey Bogart was just some tough
Then oooh baby this is just some love
Oooh baby this is just some love


Oooh baby this is just some love
Oooh baby this is just some love

To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?


'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??

Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

Lil Digger
Under the track it's Gopher City
Tunnels everywhere and it just ain't pretty
They pop outta them holes where the action's fast
Squeakin with excitement when the field goes fast
NASCAR's biggest fans
Gopher's guys and girls
There's one little guy with a gleam in his eye
He's the biggest fan in the whole wide world
 Hes the gopher racetrack king
 He wants to see everything
 Hes where the action's hot
Digger, little Digger never wants it all to stop
Got a bunch of buddies underneath the track
And they chill all week talkin NASCAR smack
They see it all, they got a front row view
As the cars fly by they spot anything new
They know who's gonna win
They know who's gonna lose
These racin gophers know their stuff
There's nothing else theyd ever choose
 Hes the gopher racetrack king
 He wants to see everything
 Hes where the action's hot
Digger, little Digger never wants it all to stop
Digger bugs old Lumpy, the grumpy trackside cop
All those Digger tunnels, old Lumpy's gonna make him stop
Marbles is the engineer, is really clever
And Annie's Digger's girl, her favorite word's "whatever"
And Grandpa's a NASCAR fan from the very beginning
He tells old Digger 'bout the glory days
When Junior Johnson kept on winning
 Hes the gopher racetrack king
 He wants to see everything
 Hes where the action's hot
Digger, little Digger, won't you never want to stop?
 Hes the gopher racetrack king
 He just gotta see everything
 Hes where the action's hot
Digger, little Digger never wants it all to stop

I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
Smoke and drink once in a while
Somehow itd be good for me
I want a cool chick thatll cook for me
Butll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
And do what I want when I want
And shell do it with me

I dont need too much of nothing
I just wanna sing a little chill song
Get my groove on
Pour something strong
Down in my drink
Oh, I know
That I dont need a whole lot of anything
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na
I just want a little bit of everything
Na na na na, na na na na

Now I dont need a garage full of cars
But Ill take a whole box of Cuban cigars
And Ill smoke em nice and slow
Like they were good for me
Dont need a ranch or a big piece of land
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
A big ole couch in a big ol' room
Still feels lonely when its just you
Yes it does


A little bit of everything
Under the sun
So, when I kick back basking in it
Ill be okay with what Ive done
Still having fun


Lord I fell for her smile
And she loved me for a while
Then she said good-bye got to go
Left me standing on the side of the road
Now she's gone and I'll be a memory of her past
And the long and short of it some things never last

Oh because summers come, summers go
I'll keep walking down this road
It's alright and it's okay
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day

Lord I'm out here again
With my back to the wind
The warm sun that's sinking low
Is going to leave me out in the cold
But the long and short of it some things never last
And if that goes for the good
It must go for the worse


If I fall down
I'm not ashamed
I always get back up again
But I'll be fine till the right one comes to save me, save me, save me
Lord I fell for her smile
And she loved me for a while
And someday she's going to wish
She hadn't left me here like this


I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day
I'll live to love another day

I cant sleep
There is no sleep coming
Im just lying here thinking about you
Im in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything were going to do
Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Want to jump in my car, go wherever you are
Because I need you by my side

Its going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

I want to see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinning like these wheels in my head tonight

Its going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

The only place that I want to be is where you are
Because anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

Its going to be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, its such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting for the sun to go down
The sun to go down

I swear its like youre waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down
Hey, yeah
Oh, Im loving thinking about you
I can't sleep, Im just lying here thinking about you
You're pretty as a daisy in an open field
The way you make me feel from the get-go
I had to let go of every little thing that Ive ever known
You shake me up like Coke in a bottle
You're a pedal to the floor, full throttle
Ain't nothin else on my mind when I see that pretty smile
Go on

Show me how it's done this side of Dixie
I'm a broke down truck, baby, won't you fix me
Just keep on dancin til the break of dawn, come on, come on
Stars fall down, make the world stop, kiss me
Wherever I go, I want you with me
Somethin bout you makes my heart run wild
You're love's poster child
Damn girl, you make me feel so free
Like a summer sun shining down on me
And we're flying so high and good Lord we ain't even trying
You got a hold on me now, like a southern wind
Taking me places Ive never been
And I'm lost in your eyes and come on darling, do it again

We've spent a long time side by side
Guess I've loved you forever
Sometimes we laughed, , at times we cried
Still we made it together
I don't know what I'd do without you
Girl you make me smile
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you
Oh, you drive me wild
Chorus:
Baby, our love is still comin' on strong
You give me strength that I needed so long
I can't explain how I feel in my heart
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart
--- Instrumental ---
Now here you are still in my arms
After so many years have gone
It seems we both were meant to be
Now that all of the tears have gone
And when it's time to settle down
And get ourselves a home
I'll be beside you all the way
Never again will you be alone
Chorus:
Baby, our love is still comin' on strong
You give me strength that I needed so long
I can't explain how I feel in my heart
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart...
I can't believe it, guess I'll never understand
Seems to me, I'm lookin' at someone who's
An unchanged man
Tell me, what've I gotta do
To make you see that she's always loved you
Right there waitin' in the wings
Unaware of the foolish things you do, think about it
CHORUS:
She would never do a thing to hurt you
And there is nothing she'd ever need to hide
You're takin everything she gives for granted
You got it all and still I don't know why
You're lovin' on the side
If somebody told her 'bout your secret ways
Do you think you'd ever find another
Who could take her place
I'd give everything I own
Just to have what you got at home
But still you are never satisfied
Why do you keep lovin' on the side when you know
REPEAT CHORUS
Tell me what I've gotta do
To make you see that she always loved you
Right there waitin' in the wings
Unaware of the foolish things you do
Well think about it
You're lovin' on the side
Lovin' on the side
REPEAT CHORUS

I was living on a landslide
Falling fast until you took my
Hand, now I won't ever let you go
Let you go
Four-leaf clover and a horses shoe
Knocking on wood was all I ever knew
I'm saving all my wishing well pennies and
I got so many ever since you came along

Sunlight shining, baby, roll the dice
Now that I got you by my side
We can't lose
No more waiting on a shooting star
I'm betting it all on your pretty heart
Baby, you're my lucky charm

Like an angel from the blue sky
Sent to save me from my dark side
Yeah, the light inside was fading
But I found salvation when I fell into your eyes


All I know is
I got your love, I got your love, baby
Yes, I do
I got your love, I got your love, baby
Oh, I got it, baby
I got your love, I got your love, baby
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa


I got your love, I got your love, baby 

I'm going to be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm going to love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I want to honor your mother
I want to learn from your pa
I want to steal your attention like a bad outlaw
I want to stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I want to make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm going to love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Coming your way
I'm going to be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm going to make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm going to be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am

And I'm going to love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us
And I'm going to love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us, oh baby

Well I ain't proud of what I'm about to do
All alone up here with you
With the picture of your man
Face down upon the night stand, so he can't see
And I don't like running all the red lights here
Every time the coast is clear
Any time you need my loving
You know I'll come running, faithfully

Cause he stays so busy with his money
And you, you get so lonely when he's gone
And me, I'm just your temporary lover
Till your blues are gone
I'm the man of the house whenever he ain't home

Now the statues on the side of that big gate
They're laughing as I drive away
And I can't keep from thinking
Are they laughing at your old man or at me
And the only part that I don't like to play
Is the part when I get up and go away
I find it mighty hard
Just keeping this old heart tucked away
Cause he stays


I'm the man of the house
When your other man ain't home

I thought I was doing all right being alone
I swore I'd never let somebody get close again
I was never gonna let my guard down Not for anyone
But there's a light in your eyes and it's got me moving' in
And tonight these walls are all coming down

And my heart is open
I'm letting you in
Cause you give me a reason and the faith I've been needing to start again
And your love is healing
I'm finally breathing
I've been waiting so long hoping for this moment
My heart is open

These days it seems like everybody's just walking away
Like there's no forever and love is just a game
But don't you know you can believe me when I say that I'm your man


I can't wait anymore, no no
Because I've got nothing left to prove
And I've got so much left to use
That's why I'm tearing out the walls and baby I'm kicking down the doors

And your love is healing
Baby, I'm finally breathing
I can hear you calling, I'm ready to fall in love again
My heart is open
My heart is open
My heart is open

I can feel your goodbye coming
Like a storm up from the south
The rain'll splatter at the back door
The wind'll whistle 'round the house
So it's you and Howie Johnston
Somebody told me at the store
I guess I'd better get used
To the idea of you
Not around anymore

And so, I'm doing' my best to prepare for the worst
And I'd better get use to the hunger and thirst
I gotta find me a potion
To take for the pain
And all you've got to lose
Is my last name

I know he's cute and he's got money
I ain't no handsome fancy Dan
In a way it's sad and kinda funny
You'll be ok and I'll be damned
So I best be getting' ready
For the bitter nights alone
Sleeping' on the couch
Wake up starting out
Living' life on my own


Yeah, all you've got to lose is my last name

You brought that bottle home in a paper sack
Drew the blinds and locked the doors
And there's nothing but empty there inside that glass
So you pour a little more
And there's no one there to judge you
At least that's what you tell yourself, but

Don't you know
Nobody drinks alone
Every demon, every ghost
From your past
And every memory you've held back
Follows you home
Nobody drinks alone

You remember whiskey on your daddy's breath
So you always stick to wine
And you scared your little brother half to death
You just kept it all inside
You can hear your mama crying
Only now she cries for you, and


Though you're lonely
Hey don't you let that feeling fool you


Nobody drinks alone

Mm hmm

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved 
It's a long shot, baby
I know it's true
But if anyone can make it
I'm betting on me and you. 
Just keep on moving into me
I know you're going to see
The best is yet to come

And don't fear it now
We're going all the way
That sun is shining on a brand new day
It's a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But we're never giving up
Because I know we've got a once in a lifetime love

Everybody's looking
For what we've found
Some wait their whole life
And it never comes around 
So don't hold back now
Just let go of all you've ever known
You can put your hand in mine


I close my eyes and I see you standing right there
Saying I do and they're throwing the rice in our hair
Well the first one's born
And a brother comes along
And he's got your smile
I've been looking back on the life we had
I'm still by your side


I've been through ups and downs
I haven't known which way to turn
And when I wander through this town
I only think of you
Chorus:
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
On the day that I was born
The cards were dealt, the dice were thrown
I think my destiny was drawn
I can only be with you
Chorus:
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Chorus:
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
In My heart is only you
And my soul is all there too
I built myself a prison cell
The walls are painted blue
Only you can let me out
Only you
Chorus:
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good, girl
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Chorus:
Only you, can take my bad heart and make it good
Only you, can take my crooked path and make it new
Only you, only you...

Well I know there's a reason
And I know there's a rhyme
We were meant to be together
That's why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand

That you're always in my heart
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone to another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah

And you're always in my heart
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way
Oh


Only you can love me this way

Your smiles they don't come easy
Like they used to come before
The awkwardness and boredom
Is scattered out across the floor
I can feel your love waxin' and waning
And a quick look in your eyes needs no explaining

I'm out on my own
Living alone

I'm an old reluctant gypsy
I don't like camping anymore
And the dreams and disappointments
Scatter out across the floor
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailing
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailing
I'm out on my own
Living alone yeah

Something deep inside of me
Must have died some time ago
I haven't called no place my home
Since nineteen-ninety-four
I'm out on my own

Thirty-somethin' single
And tired of running' everywhere
And I can wear a welcome out
When I ain't even there
I'm nervous on this train I feel it derailing
And I can read the letters that nobody's mailin'
I'm out on my own
Living' alone I'm living alone
And I got nowhere to go
Look at me I'm out on my own
I'm out on my own
But it's gonna be all right now
It's gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
Oh yes I know it and I know and I know it's gonna be all right

Well here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody, I got to set you into a groove

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song, oh oh oh
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy I'd just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because you're already there anyway, yes you are

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song
And if I get it right everybody will be singing along yeah
And when they see you on the street they'll say
Hey aren't you the girl in that song

I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I'm in love with this girl
Yeah if I could press play, rewind a couple million times
Imagine for a moment that you're all mine
Every night I'd drive you home
If I could put you in a
Let me put you in a song
Let me put you in a song
Oh a pretty little song about you baby

It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls
 
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain

Raise 'em up
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night
The band plays a song you like and you sing along
Raise em up
I'm talkin' 'bout Daddy's old pickup truck
Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on

Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
A comin' home, you've been gone too long
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

Raise 'em up
You got a voice, you got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are
Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars

Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come

Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong
Raise 'em up right from wrong
Raise 'em up so damn high they can hear God singing along
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Oooh, yeah
Ooooh, waaaah

Well, there ain't no strangers
When you're swinging a hammer side by side
Oh, had a little setback
Ain't nothing gonna stop this Southern pride
No, no

So let's all pull together now boys
Once again this town's going to make some noise
We'll be square dancing, toe tapping
We'll be clicking out heels to Cotton Eye Joe
The music laughter going to raise the rafters
A little boot sliding across the floor

Do a little hand holding, hay rolling
Strolling with your honey by your side
Dixie cups and paper plates
Fiddle tunes and amazing grace
Hallelujah, raise the barn tonight
Sing along now, babe

Well, the Lord he was willing but the creek did rise up
Lord have mercy the Bossman don't seem to care
So it's up to us to gather round, gather round
The stars are shining a little brighter than before
It's going to come alive when we swing open the door
We'll be square dancing, toe tapping
We'll be clicking out heels to Cotton Eye Joe
The music laughter going to raise the rafters
A little boot sliding across the floor




Road trip to New Orleans or gettin' married in Vegas
Sunsets down on the sand, lettin' loose and goin' crazy
Somewhere, somebody tonight is falling in love
And three hundred twenty-five horses can't get me to you fast enough

And your lips 'round a Coca-Cola
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder
Some things never go out of style
Like you and me together
Staring at your legs on the leather of my red Camaro
Of my red Camaro
Oh, oh

You got them cowgirl boots on, that summer dress blowin'
Girl, there ain't nothin' 'bout you that don't get to me and you know it
When it comes to love, it ain't ever changin'
Same things will always get a boy's heart racin'

Like your lips 'round a Coca-Cola
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder
Some things never go out of style
Like you and me together
Staring at your legs on the leather of my red Camaro
Of my red Camaro, baby

Pulling off on the side of the dirt road
So many things that we know, but we don't know
Discovering you by the glow of the dashboard light
Falling in love in the middle of nowhere
Maybe it's wrong, but it looks like we don't care
It feels right, yeah, it feels so right
Just like

Your lips 'round a Coca-Cola
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder
Some things never go out of style
Like you and me together
Your lips 'round a Coca-Cola
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder
Some things just never go out of style
Like you and me together
Staring at your legs on the black leather
Of my red Camaro
Of my red Camaro
Starin' at your legs on my red Camaro
Oh, my red Camaro

The rains coming down hard tonight
Pull the car over
Now I'm sitting alone on the roadside
I tilt the mirror down and say to me
Why you always think the answer's got to be
To just leave
I'm making the same mistake
I'm hoping it's not too late
Because I

I don't know where I would be without you now
I guess I get scared and that's why I act like such a fool
Because you're the one thing I can't lose
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I think of us baby
And all the love inside comes shining through
And it always leads me right on back to you

I never felt it
I never knew
Someone who could get inside my soul the way you do
Yes you do
Yeah you got me in the palm of your hands
It's beautiful and terrifying
Can't you see
For someone like me
But instead of running in
I know
It's when I should hold you closer
Because I
 

Because nobody's ever loved me
Like you
And I was born to be your man forever
Forever baby
Yeah
I feel the tears coming
And I want to cry
I turn the car around
And put it in drive
And I know what to do
Going to come on back
Come on back to you
Yeah

Oh, oh baby
Going to come on back
Come on back to you
Because I can't live without you
I can't breathe without you
Yeah
And I'm nothing, I'm nothing
Without you
Yeah
I was a fool, I was a fool baby
Instrumental

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

Oh, gods and years will rise and fall
And there's always something more
Lost in talk, I waste my time
And it's all been said before
While further down behind the masquerade the tears are there
I don't ask for all that much I just want someone to care
That's right now

Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Come on out beneath the shining sun
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run

It's king and queen and we must go down now beyond the chandelier
Where I won't have to speak my mind and you won't have to hear
Shreds of news and afterthoughts and complicated scenes
We'll weather down behind the light and fade like magazines

So meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Ooh baby
Hey hey, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

Oh yea, meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you everything's okay
Let me see you smiling back at me
Oh yea, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Hold me tight and love and loving's free

So meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Oh sweet baby
What you heard is true
The disappointing truth
Is I don't like to lose
Shame on me, shame on me
Promises I made
And bills I never paid
Another missed birthday
Shame on me, shame on me
Bridges that I burned
And lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

Hey, I'm not tryin to be perfect
Its not like its worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame
I repeat my words
Sometimes they seem rehearsed
And I speak out of turn
Shame on me, shame on me
Bridges that I burned
And lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

Hey, I'm not tryin to be perfect
Its not like its worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame
That were hiding underneath our skin
And were scared of letting somebody in
Nobody showed us how to live
Or how to be perfect
Its not like its worth it

Hey, I'm not tryin to be perfect
Its not like its worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame

So much for never making the same mistake
I can't believe I'm here again
So much for ever thinking that I could change
My good intentions still remain in chains

She's got to be over me now
Probably moved on with her life
Found someone she knows she can believe
God I would give anything if I could just go back again
And be the man she needed me to be

I thought I was a hero
I played him well
He saves the day but not himself
I acted out the lover
My finest part
Had all the lines but not the heart
Now look where we are


Be the man that she could trust, who put her first
Who tamed his demons, who healed her hurts
In health and sickness, who helped her grow
With no resentment, true repentance, God as my witness
 

She needed me to be
She needed me to be, oh
Whoa, hallelujah
Yeah, I could be that man she needed me, she needed me to be
I'm a lucky man, yes, I am
Living in Heaven down here on earth
Her Tennessee smile drives me wild
Don't you know, I know what its worth
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel good

Shes my radio turned up to 11
Shes my country song that I just gotta sing along to
So fine, so fine, like the finest wine
Shes my blue-eyed dream, my summer queen
I can't believe shes mine, all mine
Mine, all mine, all mine
Mine, all mine, all mine
That cool breeze kiss from her lips
Is what I'm missing when I'm gone
To tell the truth my heart's shot through
When it comes to love, she can do no wrong
Shes every little thing in life that makes me feel so good

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
She got my heart skippin a beat
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
She got me dancin in the street

Mine, all mine, all mine

Winter's weighing on your shoulders
It's hanging around a little too long
And I can see it in your eyes
You've taken on a load that's just too strong
Oh, but let me get down to the heart of the matter
Baby, if you want I can make it better now

When the sun is hard to find
When it's raining in your eyes
When the shadows block those pretty little blue skies living inside you
When the falling of your tears, makes a candle disappear
When you just can't see the light
Baby, I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine

Everybody's got a cross to carry
Everybody's got a story they can tell
You know you're not the only one counting on a quarter and wishing well
Woah don't you sit there with your heart under lock and key
Give me one chance baby, I can set you free


Sometimes in this life good luck doesn't shine like it suppose to do
When there's no one you can trust and they just keep on giving up on you
Baby, don't you know that I won't ever let you down
Come on now, woo
Oh, don't sit there with your heart under lock and key
Just give me one chance and baby, I can set you free

When the sun is hard to find
When it's raining in your eyes
And the shadows block those pretty little blue skies living inside you
When the falling of your tears, makes a candle disappear
And you just can't see the light
Baby, I'll find a way to shine
I'll find a way to shine
Find a way to shine
Find a way to shine
You know I'll find a way

Find a way, find a way
Find a way to shine

Let's get into the point, when we are not listening anymore!
Just walking round in circles and wearing holes out in the floor
I'm tired; I know you're tired and it's late
And it's almost four
What are you trying to achieve?
What are you trying to win?
I said the same thing three hours ago
And now I'm saying it again
And I know you well enough to know
Neither one of us is giving in!

Baby, I love you I'm not going to bed angry
Baby, I need you and I want you to be happy
We've been going around in circles with no end in sight
Maybe we should just
Shut out the lights
And wait till the morning
Shut out the lights
Wait till the morning
Yeah

It's amazing all the awkward moments
We still carry around
We wait to bring it all up when it all comes down
The light is coming right now!


Because I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to feel these
The times that I'm going to to make you say
Things you don't mean in the heat of the moment
In the heat of the moment




There's a new wind blowing like I've never known
I'm breathing deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do
I want to love somebody
Love somebody like you
And I am letting go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I want to do
I want to love somebody
Love somebody like you

Yeah, I want to feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do

I used to run in circles going nowhere fast
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to
I want to love somebody
Love somebody like you
Whoa! here we go now!
Hey I want to love ya baby

Yeah, I want to feel the sunshine
Shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand
But you're teaching me to be a better man
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no
I want to love somebody
Love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody
Love somebody like you. Ooh
And I want to love somebody
Love somebody like you, yeah
Oh yeah
Hey I want to love ya baby


Oh, I want to be the man in the middle of the night
Shining like its true
I want to be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found its way
Want to be a better man
I see it in you yeah
Hey, I wanna be that...

It was about five till five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show
He said "You and you come with me
'Cause you're gonna have to stay"
My heart was thumping I was jumping
I had to get away

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
When the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

Well I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
When she asked a loaded question
She said "How do you feel about me?"
My mind was racing' I was pacing'
But the words just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing left to do
I feel it coming on


Some days you gotta dance
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
I'm driving home tonight, catching all red lights
That's alright cause I don't want to be alone
There's nobody waitin there, cold and empty bed
Words I wished I'd said come on the radio
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I do this to myself
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're with someone else
But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back
But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind were somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget, you grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
Id give anything if I could bring it back oh oh

Lately I've been noticing
I say the same things he used to say
And I even find myself acting the very same way
I tap my fingers on the table
To the rhythm in my soul
And I jingle the car keys
When I'm ready to go
When I look in the mirror
He's right there in my eyes
Staring back at me and I realize

The older I get
The more I can see
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That everyday I see
A little more of my father in me

There were times I thought he was being
Just a little bit hard on me
But now I understand he was making me
Become the man he knew that I could be
In everything he ever did
He always did with love
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad
I just smile and say you already have

He's in my eyes
My heart, my soul
My hands, my pride
And when I feel alone
And I think I can't go on
I hear him saying "Son you'll be alright"
Everything's going to be alright"
Yes it is


A little more of my father in me
I hope everyday I see in me
In me
In me
I hope everyday I see
A little more of my father in me

Out on the street corner
Just like every morning I sit here
And I watch you walk my way
And even though I don't know you
As you get closer I swear I feel
My heart start racing, aching
Maybe it's in my mind
And maybe I'm only dreaming
And I swear you catch my eye
As you walk on by
Oh why you gotta leave me so blue

Baby why can't you see
That I'm the only one for you
You could search the world over
But you'll never find another so true
Cause if you're looking for love
I'm standing right in front of you

I bet your heart, like mine
Has been broken by someone
We never should have given it to 
So we put up a wall to keep from falling so hard
It's so sad
Cause there's such good love inside
And I've been hoping that I might find
Someone who feels the same way
Someone to share my life
On this beautiful ride together
We could see it all through


So this morning I'm just going to walk up and say hello to you
Cause if given a choice between love and being alone
I know which one
I know which one I choose
And give me a chance
I'd be a better man for you 
And open your heart girl
Let me make your dreams come true

You can search the world over
But I can take it to the moon
Cause if you're looking for love
I'm standing right in front of you 
Standing right in front of you
Open your eyes, I'm standing right in front of you
Just give me a chance baby
I'm standing right in front of you

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Stuck in the middle with you

Well, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what is I should do
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face
Lose control and I'm all over the place
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you

Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud you're a self-made man
And your friends they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"

Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you

Here I am, here I am
Stuck in the middle with you

Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different

Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh

So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Ooh, yeah

Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
Yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
I'm the same old, same old stupid boy

It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone

Ah, she's gone, she's long gone
Yes, she's gone
Yeah, oh
Nobody's ever going to love me like she loved me
And she loved me, she loved me
God, please, just let her know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Baby
Yeah, I'm down on my knees
She's never coming back to me

Keith Urban! Mr. Worldwide!
They say life is short
So I'ma live it up
Tonight it's goin' down
'Til the Sun comes up, dale

2 a.m. and I'm about to lose my mind
The way she's movin' that black dress like her hips are on fire
Deer in the headlights, dancin' like she's in a movie scene
To die for, and it's killin' me

Stars are out
But they're fadin' fast, gotta make it last
And I'm so close to heaven
But just hold tonight, cause I need the light

Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Sun don't let me down

Hey don't get me wrong, I like the way you shine
I know you love kissin' on her skin, but it's my turn tonight
Starin' at her lips, playin' with my name
Whisperin', callin' me, she's pullin' me in
Like I'm on a chain

Stars are out
Yeah they're in the sky, like they're in her eyes
I think I found my heaven
But just have a heart, stay where you are

Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down


Life is short so I'm livin' it up
Tonight it's goin' down, yeah, 'til the Sun comes up
Then we do it all again cause we ain't givin' a what!
And all the women in the party givin' it up
Time is money and I ain't wastin' no time
So fill my cup with Voli, water and lime
Takin' shots for the soldiers in the field
Thanks for the freedom, and that's for real
Tonight we're gettin' hammered, bang up a tank
That means get off the chain, let loose and drink
Mami wanna play the adult version of truth or dare
So I took her to the back and pulled her hair, yeah

Sun don't let me down
She's almost in my arms right now
I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down

She's almost in my arms right now

I know you gotta rise for the birds to sing
But I need the moonlight to do my thing
Sun don't let me down
Sun don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't come around
Stay underground
Don't let me down
Sun don't let me down

When I picked you up for our first date baby
Well, your pretty blue eyes, they were driving' me crazy
And the tiny little thought that was so amazing
Is they were looking at me
I held open the car door for you then you climbed
Inside and slid on over
To the other side.. I thought my, oh my

Sweet thing
The moon is high and the night is young
Come on and meet me
In the backyard under the cottonwood tree
It's a good thing and I'm wishing
C'mon sweet thing
Won't you climb on out of your window
While the world is sleeping
Cause you know I need you
And there's no way I'll be leaving
Till we're kissing on the porch swing
Oh my little sweet thing

Yeah I know I'm gonna see you first thing tomorrow
But I just couldn't wait so I had to borrow
Uncle Jake's mustang, its his favorite car
And so I can't stay long..
Standing here feeling like a love struck Romeo
All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?


Sweet thing, sweet thing


Oh come-on sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thing

Yeah, come-on now a little now..
Do do do do do do do do do do do
Oh my little sweet thing, yes you are
Do do do do do do do do do do do

You know the cards are stacked against this
As we surrender our defenses
And I've torn down all my fences just for you
And you feel it too
What do we do
Do we run or see it through

The longer we're together
It just keeps getting better
And you hide your little love letters
Around the house for me
And it's plain to see
That you'll always be all I'll ever need
The webs we spun
Wove into one
And left us tangled up in love

You squeeze my hand I understand
About a woman and a man
I love the way you make me feel
You got me tangled up in love
The webs we spun
Wove into one
Left us tangled up in love


There were nights where I was sure
I wouldn't see the morning sun
And there were days that seemed so dark
I couldn't wait for night to come
I couldn't stand to think about how
My life used to be
And how without a single warning
It all slipped away from me
Like a fool I thought I could fight
The shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger
But this was stronger than I'd known
And by the time I knew that I was in too deep I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me
Had faded from my heart
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go
Surrounded by stangers I was so far away from home
And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe you everything
Yes I do

And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
And I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
I'm seeing for the first time
The stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothing on the power
Of this love I have for you
And I thank you, thank you

Now people say they'll stand beside you
They swear they'll never leave
But when the rain started falling
You know it only fell on me
And it was hard to keep believing in myself
When all I felt was so much pain and guilt and shame
I couldn't even ask for help
I don't know if I believe in other lives
But when you came
There was something so familiar
About the way you said my name
And the whole world started turning
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new
And it's all because of you


And I've seen so many things
That I just can't explain
But the miracle of miracles is how
With your love I was saved


And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
The day I started breathing
Was the day you took my hand
And 'til the day I die
Baby
I'll forever be your man
And I thank you, I thank you

Wide awake staring at my phone
Who's gonna give in first?
We don't have to be all alone
We don't have to feel this hurt
Member those nights in your driveway
Feeling like the only ones left on earth
And maybe I'm crazy
But I think that maybe

That could still be us
Cause it still is sometimes at night when my eyes are shut
Wish I could say it don't get to me but it does
And I know I probably think about you way too much
But that's because
That could still be us

I went down to the riverbank
Looked in the water and saw your face
This small town summer wind
Whispers all my mistakes
Member those nights in your backyard
Making each other shake
And lately it kills me
And nothing can fill me
Cause

That could still be us
Cause it still is sometimes at night when my eyes are shut
Wish I could say it don't get to me but it does
And I know I probably think about you way too much
But that's because
That could still be us
That could still be us
That could still be us
That could still be us

Tail lights fading in the dark
I shoulda called out your name
I go by there some nights and park
Replay it all again
What woulda been
What shoulda been
What was

That could still be us
Cause it still is sometimes at night when my eyes are shut
Wish I could say it don't get to me but it does
And I know I probably think about you way too much
But that's because
That could still be us
That could still be us
That could still be us
That could still be us
That could still be us

I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise, I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

You've got your own way of looking at it baby
I guess that proves that I got mine
Seems like our hearts are set on automatic
We say the first thing that comes to mind
It's just who we are baby, we've come too far to start over now
I know what you're thinking; I'm not always easy to be around

But I do love you
You keep me believing that you love me too
And I know it's true
This love drives us crazy but nobody's walking away
So, I guess we'll to do it the hard way

If I had a genie in a bottle
Three wishes I could wish for us
I wish we'd live forever and get along together
Turn these tempers into trust


Do it the hard way
It's just who we are baby, we've come to far to start over now
Believe me tonight love's the one thing in life we can't live without


Do it the hard way
The hard way

You know when I'm coming home
You know when I'm coming to bed
You know when I tell you that I love you
I mean every word I said
You know I'm a bit too proud
You know that I know how to pray
And you know I won't give this up, unless I have to give it up
You know I won't walk away

But baby you are like a diesel truck
You're shifting gears and the pedals stuck
You're headed straight for the edge
And showing no signs of slowing
And I don't have the luxury of knowing

You know that I like to dance
But only when I'm dancing with you
You know I must be bad at lying
Because I've only ever told you the truth
But just when I think you're a hurricane
You freeze right over and all that rain
Turns to ice and your whole world just starts snowing
And I don't have the luxury of knowing
Well damn, it must be easy, being in love with someone so blind
Because I tell you right now, the only the thing I really know
Is that you might you change your mind
Any day you could change your mind
But you know when I'm coming home
You know when I'm coming to bed

I know a place where love flows like water
You sit on the bank and pass the time away
So take my hand I want to show you something
My very own lover's hideaway
CHORUS:
And I will take you down the river
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree
I'll take you down to the river
Where you and I can just be you and me
I see us know just lyin' underneath the heavens
Sippin' on wine with nothing much to do
Just you in my arms when the sun is settin'
Then makin' sweet love in the night of Mr Moon
REPEAT CHORUS
You know I"ll love you anyway
All I will feel the same until the sun don't shine
All I want to do is stay
Cause you're a once in every lifetime oohh
REPEAT CHORUS 2x

My grandma was a wise old soul
Took me by the hand not long ago
Said, "Son, what's your hurry, boy slow it down
Taste the wild honey, listen to the sound
Of the wind that's blowing through the trees
Rivers flowing to the sea
Yeah they're all heading home just like you and me
Life's for living children, can't you see?"

These are the days we will remember
These are the times that won't come again
The highest of flames become an ember
And you got to live them while you can

These are the days we will remember
These are the days we will remember
These are the days we will remember
These are the days we will remember

So take them by the hand, they're yours and mine
Take them by the hand and live your life
Take them by the hand don't let them all fly by
Come on, Come on now

Ooo days go by
Yeah, just like a hand out the window waving in the wind as the cars go by
Days go by

Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around

I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'tell you just might come back

But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Till summer comes around

Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And "Baby I'll be back again" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'til summer comes around

Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I want to cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
"All By Myself" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way
 

Sounds real good now
If I could be anywhere with anyone
You know exactly where'd I'd be
Under the covers waiting for the sun to rise
Your head on the pillow next to me
Your feet propped up on that kitchen chair
Morning papers scattered all around you
Coffee brewing on the cast iron stove
And the pleasure of just knowing that you're mine

Well, I love the way you look
Love the way you feel
And the way you roll your eyes
At the kisses that I steal
Love the way you stare
When you're staring right at me
I just love your company
Oh, yes, I do

Arm in arm on some Spring sidewalk day
Laughing just because it feels so right
Wrapped up under the blankets all cozy by the fire
As long as you're here close enough to touch



Women think I'm tasty
But they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby
Don't need no jewels in my crown
'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy
There's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Keep on rolling
Got to roll me
Keep on rolling
Got to roll me
Keep on rolling
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me

And so I wrote this song for you
I think I know just what you're going through
Did you believe you'd never change
Nothing ever stays the same
I know it's hard with holding on
And even harder trying to let it go
And so you're frozen like a stone
But you are not alone

Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving into love
Love, let it out
Believe me when I say
It gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain

What you hide inside I see
There's a scar that's always gonna be
And there's a past in everyone
You can't undo, you can't outrun

Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving into love
Love, let it out
Believe me when I say
It gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain
Every step I take
I get a little less afraid
Of giving into love
Love, let it out
Believe me when I say
It gets better every day
Once you get used to the pain

Once you get used to the pain

Running from the rate race
Just as fast as I can
Take off my tie so I can breathe
Me, I'm going where the fresh air's blowing
Take a little walk in the country with me

Walk in the country with me
Watch the sun sinking down on the trees
It's gonna do us some good
To get down in the woods
Take a little walk in the country with me

I'm so sick of all them TV shows
I need some dirt road under my feet
C'mon let's point our toes where the red fern grows
Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now


Walking the country
Oh bless my soul
Just gimme that country road
Come on now


Take a little walk in the country with me
Come on now baby
Take a little walk in the country with me

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game

And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loco's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

When I think about those summer night
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time

Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time

Rear-view crosses
Railroad ties
Oh Hail Marys
Friday nights
Heartbeat baby
Low-beam lights
God I miss when, you were mine

Back when that song was a song
I could sing along without thinkin' bout you every time it came on
Every beat, every line, every word, every time
When a road was a road
I could roll on through without wishin' that empty seat was you
Money was gas, dreams were dust
Love was fast and we were us

Shotgun sunset
A cool mint kiss
Backseat promise
Breaking it
Floorboard feeling
County lines
God, I miss when you were mine


In a sleepy town, just jumping in
Far too young to know that summers end
We were us, we can't go back
It's what it is, but God I miss


Every beat, every line, every word, every single time
I just close my eyes and you're ridin' shotgun
You and me, baby, on the run
I miss you baby 
I'm living in a world that won't stop pulling on me
I'm not complaining but it's true
It's like I owe my time to everyone else
Because that's all I seem to do
You might not notice but I need a good friend
Someone to talk to when I'm down, down, down
There's so much on my mind that I want to get out
But there's no one around

Sometimes I can't help thinking what about me
Some days go by that I don't even see
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free
Oh is this the way it's always going to be
What about me
Well I was Dreamin I'm on a highway with the windows down
I'm burning up the road at my own speed
But I'm stuck here going nowhere in this traffic jam
And there's a woman with her kids in the car next to me
And I swear she's singing
 

Ooo what about me
Hey what about me
You come here lookin' for sympathy
Cause it's not everything you thought it would be
Don't waste your time
You can't understand why it comes and goes
The sudden storms, the highs and lows
So you stand here cryin'
Girl get in line
Chorus:
What love is that way
You're waitin' time pretending
What love is that way
When you walk through life expecting
So much, so soon
Love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way
The more you wish and the more you dream
The more the reality never seems
What it ought to be
It's never perfect as when it begins
Time always seems to put an end
To the fantasy, It seems to me
Repeat chorus
So much, so soon, Love can only hurt you
What love is that way
What love is ever that way, What love is that way
Repeat to fade

I've seen that darkness on the edge of town
The sun comes up and the rain fall down
And I've been a fool, yeah I've been around
And when the world got too much for me
I took off and left a memory
Thinking I'd find something better for me somehow
Oh but now

Whenever I run
Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
Is where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to

I used to quit when it got too tough
Throw in my cards when I was down on my luck
But baby you mean too much to me
So now

I never could stay in one place too long
I never could stand that still
Ah but you changed so much in me
And now I know I will
I'm going to stay where the love is right
I'm so tired of being a bird in flight
Good love takes work
Ah but that's alright
That's alright


Instead of running into the blue
I follow my heart
And there in your arms
That's where I find the love I need
And the best is yet to come
Baby you're the one I run to
The one I run to
The one I run to

Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

I'm looking' down the barrel of Friday night
Riding' on a river of freeway lights
Goodbye city I'm country bound
Till Monday rolls around

Gonna kick off my shoes
And run in bare feet
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet
Going' back to the well gonna visit old friends
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends

Working in the grind is an uphill road
Punching that clock and carrying that load
I bust it all week and then I'm free
The weekend belongs to me


Give me some fresh air give me that farm
Give me some time with you in my arms
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise


Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends
Where the blacktop ends

I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
I had a job and I lost it
But it won't get to me
Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away

And the sun is shining
This road keeps winding
Through the prettiest country
From Georgia to Tennessee
And I got the one I love beside me
My troubles behind me
I'm alive and I'm free
Who wouldn't want to be me

Now she's strumming on my six-string
Across her pretty knees
She's stompinstomping out a rhythm
And singing to me the sweetest song
 {x2]

I got no money in my pockets
I got a hole in my jeans
We're on the wheels of an angel
And I'm free
She's strummingg on my six-string
It's across her pretty knees
She's Stomping out a rhythm
And she's singin' to me

I just kissed you goodbye a half an hour ago
I know you've driven to the airport
But I just gotta pick up the phone
And hear you one more time
Saying my name
I must be going outta my mind

Why's it feel so long
Since you've been gone
Why's it feel so long
Time keeps dragging on
Till you get back home
Why's it feel so long
Baby now
Cause I miss you babe

I've never loved anyone like I love you
So when you're not around
I must confess I lose myself
And I don't know who or where I am
I might be crazy
Crazy about being your man


When I finally see you
I know it'd be like never left alone
But there's no cantillation
Tonight isn't waiting
Praying maybe you'll come
Coming coming babe
Tell me now


I look in my watch
Stare at the clock
They don't move
I don't either, I'm just frozen on the couch
Oh the seconds feel like hours
Hour is like a day
It's twilight zone in this home
When you go away

At least don't go away

One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldnt be found
I was so far down
That I couldnt get up, you know

One day I was one of lifes losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head I was lost before I began
I had a dream
But it turned to dust
And what I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door

Im winning, Im winning
Im winning, oh yeah
Im winning
And Im winning
And I dont intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And not meant to be
It took a long time
But I knew for now
I can see the day
That I believe for
Friends agree theres a need
To play the game
And to win again, let me tell you now


Now I had a dream
But it turned to dust
And what I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door
Yes she was how, hey
 

I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet
It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that

The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

Oh Without you yea yea

Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other



Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions


Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you
Without you

Everybody says that when it comes to friends
The truest kind is counted on one hand
But take a look around before you hit the ground
The only one you'll see will be this man

Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall
Because I'm the one who loves you
You'll never wonder if I care, I'll always be there
Standing there in losing ground
I'm your best friend now and I won't let you down
No, oh

Yes, I've been a fool but I've learned what not to do
Don't take for granted those who keep their faith in you
And if you lose your way on some rainy day
Just look above and I will be the sunshine breaking through


And every step along the highway of your life
I'll be the man standing beside you
Believe me that I will
Don't forget you came and you saved me
You saved my life

Yeah, I'll catch you when you fall
Because I'm the one who loves you
You'll never wonder if I care, I'll always be there
Standing there in losing ground
Because I'm your best friend now
And I won't let you, I will not let you
I won't let you down

Give me a hundred acres, cut a path through the long leaf pines
A little piece of paper saying everything I see is mine
As long as youre beside me, its all the same when the daylight ends
I aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
I aint never gonna worry bout nothin again

Make the money but the money aint gonna make me
Doin' nothin, I dont really want to
Tryin to make the money but the money aint gonna make me
Doin' nothin but spend a little time on you

You sittin there lookin all pretty
In the sunset tree line half-drunk with me
And I love that feelin when the smile starts kickin in
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
You sittin there lookin all pretty
In the sunset tree line sparkin up with me
And I love that feelin when the smile starts kickin in
I aint never gonna worry bout nothin again

Ill take a blue sky highway, Painted Desert to the Vegas strip
Or a sleepy hometown with just one or two street lights lit
Where the blacktop dies and the gravel begins
Me and you skinny dippin where the river bends
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
I aint never gonna worry bout nothin again

Paint the barn roof See Rock City
Kickin back just a couple of sunshine hippies
Yeah, the way that you and the smoke and the whiskey blend
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
Paint the barn roof See Rock City
Kickin back just a couple of sunshine hippies
Yeah, the way that you and the smoke and the whiskey blend
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
Oh, nothing again


Make the money but the money aint gonna make me
Doin' nothin, I dont really want to
Tryin to make the money but the money aint gonna make me
Doin' nothin but spend a little time on you, you

You sittin there lookin all pretty
In the sunset tree line half-drunk with me
And I love that feelin when the smile starts kickin in
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
Paint the barn roof See Rock City
Kickin back just a couple of sunshine hippies
Yeah, the way that you and the smoke and the whiskey blend
Aint never gonna worry bout nothin again
Oh, nothing again
Eh, nothing again
I remember as a kid wishin' I was seventeen
No more school, my own car
Back then it was all a dream
Then came the day to say goodbye to the
Room that was once mine
One last look at my old world then
I closed the door behind, to
Chorus:
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
Well thirty-five soon rolled around
And everything had changed
I could count friends on one hand and
The good times weren't the same
But finally I cam to understand why people say
Don't spend all your childhood wishin'
The best years away
Chorus:
Yesterday, everything was easy
Livin' life like there was no tomorrow
Now everyday memories still remind me
How good things used to be yesterday
Now I'm longin' for the freedom
That I let slip away
I took it all for granted
Now it's gone like yesterday
Chorus X2
Remembering all those years, yesterday

One, two, three baby don't think twice
Just like that you got a brand new life
Hop in this truck and run through the red lights
Yeah where you want to go baby name the town
We can go up north, we could head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud
Come on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double leave your troubles behind
You and me, we're going to be alright

You could be a blackbird
On the country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me
You could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me

Well, here we are baby in the back of my bed
Suns going down skies turning red
Stars coming out
Baby look at you now
God knows how long but it's been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby I could get used to this


You are going to fly

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cap and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

And you're going to think of me
Oh yeah
Ooh someday baby, someday
Oooh ooh ooh oh
Think of me
Ooh ooh dumdum dirumdum baby

When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you
And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

Come on now
Aww, that's right
Oh, you look so fine
Eh, yeah

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt

One, two, three, four
You look good in my shirt
Yeah, yeah

Outside my window
I swear on my mama's grave
Faded out the street noise
Like a out of focus Polaroid
So I shot the moon
And I cursed the wind
Making me think
That you were here again
Smoke and mirrors
Somebody stole you away
That's the biggest conspiracy
Since, JFK
So we combed the corners
And glass houses
But the right directions
We never found it
Well, I'd trade in all the rest of my days
Just the mere reflection of your face
For one shining moment
With you or somebody like you
With you or somebody just like you
Called inspectors
The cops and the CIA
They drew chalk circles 'round
The place that we used to lay
But nobody testified
Not a single witness
I swore, I was crucified
With no forgiveness
And the sheriff shined his light
Like I was drunk and dangerous
My hands were already tied
So he put away his handcuffs
And in my blind spot
I saw the silhouette
Your crazy legs smoking
A long black cigarette
But I'd trade in all the rest of my days
Your crooked smile, your wicked ways
I'd fill up all this empty space
With you or somebody like you
With you or somebody just like you
Oh, you or somebody like you, oh
Now I should've learned my lesson
Done what I was told
Should've counted all my blessings
Like fingers and toes
And now I'm tripping like a blind man
And searchin' high and low
For you or somebody like you
For you or somebody just like you
For you or somebody like you
For you or somebody just like you, oh, oh
Yeah, whoa, somebody just like you
Oh, somebody just like you, oh
Come on get ya you're only baby
Come on get ya put it on me baby

All the burnin lights
Go rushin by
Im drivin like a wild man outta the city
Gotta leave the madness behind
This jungle world gets so insane
Its a damned if you do
Damned if you dont kinda deal
In this crazy game
Shinin in the darkness
Brighter than the sun
You fall into me
And we are one

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
Whenever my body is touching your body

Your slight of hand
And your fire lips
Like a man with a habit
All I knows I gotta have it
Yeah, the magic in your fingertips
The things you do
And the love we make
Underneath the covers
You carry me away

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
When I'm touching your body

They say, nothing lasts forever
We make that so untrue
When forevers come and gone
Ill still be holding on to you

And everything in the world is right
Stars align whenever my body
Is touching your body
And when I got your skin on mine
Fear gives way to heaven inside me
Whenever my body is touching your body
Whenever my body is touching your body
Come on get ya you're only baby
Come on get ya put it on me baby
Come on get ya you're only baby
Come on get ya put it on me baby

Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight

And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half
Uuuuh I need your love
Well, you take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and I understand
It's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe that we can make it through anything

Baby it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half
Oh oh baby you're my better half
Oooh, hey baby you're my better half

We all drink to forget
Some of us more than most
When reality gets too real
And the fires of hell to close
But I'm here to let you know that
That you can make it through
If you believe that someone is watching over you

And call it an angel
Call it a muse
And call it karma that you've got coming to you
What's the difference
What's in a name
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
Because it's going to be alright
You're not alone tonight

We all have our days
When nothing goes as planned
Not a soul in the world
Seems to understand
And for someone to talk to
You'd give anything
Well go on and cry out loud
Because someone's listening


Keep your faith alive
You're not the only one


Oh you can cry if you want to, go on

It's just a piece of paper, it says, "In God We Trust"
A little sure felt good
But a lot was not enough
And everybody loved me when I was on a roll
And I thought I had everything
When I held the gold

But you're not my god
And you're not my friend
You're not the one that I will walk with in the end
You're not the truth
You're a temporary shot
You ruin people's lives and you don't give a second thought
You're not my god

Little white lines on a mirror
Cut neatly in a roll
A medicine that kept me from looking in my soul
I thought you were the answer
To all of my despair
And you almost had me six feet down
But I'm still breathing air


From the cradle to the grave
Temptations all around
But no matter how good the fix
It's going to take you down
Now some call it a weakness
Some call it a sin
But it's all the same behind each game
I see your evil grin
 

You're not my god
Oh oh oh you're not my god
You're not my god
Mmmmm not my god
Not my god
You're not, you're not, you're not my god
No you're not
I know it's gonna take some time
For you to trust this love of mine
I know he broke your heart in two
You've been betrayed and ... you're afraid
That I will do the same to you
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away
You ... You know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes

I know you've heard this all before

You're the one that I adore

You make me shine just like the sun

You bring this heart of mine undone

For every lie you've ever heard
You can believe my every word... yes you can
Whatever heaven holds in store
Through good and bad ... I'll be your man
Stand beside you through it all
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away
And you ... you know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes

I know you've heard this all before

Your the one that I adore

You make me shine just like the sun

You bring this heart of mine undone

I know you've heard this all before

But your the one that I adore

You make me shine just like the sun

You bring this heart of mine undone


Make me shine just like the sun ... yes you do


The first time I looked in your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face I felt
Like I've never felt with anyone else

I wanna give back what you've giving to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything

When you wake up, I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out for me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
And I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost

I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
And be the hand that lifts your veil
And be the moon that moves your tide
The sun coming up in your eyes
Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything

Be the wheels that never rust
And be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreaming of and more
So much more, I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything
The first time I looked in your eyes I knew
That I would do anything for you
The first time you touched my face I felt
What I'd never felt with anyone else
I wanna give back what you've given to me
And I wanna witness all of your dreams
Now that you've shown me who I really am
I wanna be more than just your man
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides
The sun comin' up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything
When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me
I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts
I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails
Be the hand that lifts your veil
Be the moon that moves your tides
The sun comin' up in your eyes
Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything
Be the wheel that never rusts
Be the spark that lights you up
All that you've been dreamin' of and more
So much more
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything
I wanna be your everything

I know it's gonna take some time
For you to trust this love of mine
I know he broke Youre heart in two
You've been betrayed and   Youre afraid
That I will do the same to you

But you'll be safe here in my arms   forever and a day
Though you don't believe me now   I'll never walk away

But Youre the one that I adore

You bring this heart of mine undone


Make me shine just like the sun, yes you do


There was a world outside my door
I wasn't in touch with anymore
There was a way I used to feel
I knew what was and wasn't real
You built a bridge, I tore it down
I felt safe on shaky ground
And I was a master of despair
Making believe I didn't care

I shouldn't be standing here today
After all the crazy things I've done
I'm ready to fall and that's OK
I ran as far as I could run
You won

Out of a world turned upside down
It took some time to come around
Out of a dream you made me whole
Yes you did
You lit a fire down in my soul
 

I'm ready to fall
I thought I knew what I was doing
I thought I was in control
I thought nobody could slow me down
But what did I know
I was just a kid, a motherless child
No one to watch over me I was running wild
Free of all responsibility till my life
And my love for myself caught up with me
Yeah, it caught up with me
And now I'm , yes I am
So ready

I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no no
Good time Charlie got me now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool
Yeah girl I must have really showed you

Cause all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I was Elvis rocking on the bar
Working the crowd pouring out my heart

And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you comeback kid
Yay I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

I've been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong
How he, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see
You're too pretty to be left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him?
Are you leaving with me?
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him?
Are you leaving with me?

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do

Are you leaving with him?
Are you leaving with me?
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him?
Or are you leaving with me?

It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him?
Are you leaving with me?
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him?
Are you leaving with me?
Are you really leaving with him?
Or are you leaving with me?
Come on girl, won't you go with me

I arent been doing to right
Since I met her last night
Some kind of burning breakfast
Lost at work state of mind
We're meeting here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kind of sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff
But I'm feeling out of place
But baby's on the way

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Arent going to try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "when you fell from heaven did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just going to wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my get to know her better file
Hey its a real good day
Cause baby's on the way

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way
Oh, yeah yeah

It's just a simple case of can't wait
Got to be great to see her again
Got to be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in

I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I got to do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way

Hey, yeah, my baby's on the way
Yeah, yeah, baby's on the way

Girl you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There arent nothing left for us I think enough's enough
I look down see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around, baby you can have it all

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I arent coming back
I've been there done that

Street by street and town after little town
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're probably wondering how I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should
To try to make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see
We weren't meant to be

I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've been there done that

I'll wake up, and I'll start to second guess myself
And I'll crave your touch, oh but I know too well

That I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time's the last time baby
I can only change who I am so much
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
No, I ain't coming back
I've been there done that

Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing along

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby
Boots stiring up the dirt Cottonfield concert
You got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere 
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Oh, oh, oh

I got the key turned back, windows down
I'm turning it up and your spinnin' around
Takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl, you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
LUKE BRYAN
Honey suckle in the air, breese blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
Your my favorite song, won't you let me sing-a-long
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights
Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby, boots stiring up the dirt
Cottonfield concert, you got the beautiful, I got the cooler full
Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so

Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips
Girl your looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

I'm feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkey-tonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pilled my hat down low, wouldn't want you to know I was in this shape

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now that's really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold, memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine

Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah, they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Better than my heart

We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code, it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers, yeah, yeah, uh huh

Time can fly on by, everything can change
Until the day we die, we'll always remain
Yeah, we'll remain
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah, brothers like that don't come cheap

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day you still had us
Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yea brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight you cry you lie you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall

Buddies, they roll up in the morning and hand you a coffee
Tell ya hurry up, the fish ain't gonna wait on you
Buddies, they don't give you no warning
When they shoot up a stop sign out on some old county road

I've got ones that I've fought with and outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
One on the wagon and one out there dragging a plow
Behind an old John Deere
They work hard for their money, their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding buddies


Buddies, they smell trouble 'fore it happens
And when it starts to happen they're right with you rolling in a parking lot
Buddies, they make your girlfriends so mad, and keep your mama from sleeping
'Cause they both know too well that I've got

Ones that I've fought with and outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
One on the wagon and one out there dragging a plow
Behind an old John Deere
They work hard for their money, their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding buddies

I got one on a Humvee that keeps all of us free
And one that got his heart broke and went half crazy
Got one that moved far away, one that rings my phone every day
The one when he hears this he'll shed a tear
They work hard for their money, everything they've got's muddy
All my beer drinking, deer dragging, dusty dirt road riding, tailgating good time, trash talking buddies

All true

You're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know

You're a buzzkill, every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what this night was going to be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
Baby, you're a buzzkill

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause


As if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill


How many butts can you fit in the backseat?
How many cans can you throw in a floorboard?
Mama's credit card and your brother's I.D
6 bodies, one bed good lord

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

Alabama baby pulling up in a black jeep
Two Georgia boys holler hey what's up
Parking lot, piggy back burnin' the bare feet
They're coming in hot somebody best get the door

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

Checkin' in with your mama now and then knowing she can't sleep, hey
Yeah, hold it down
Hey mama, yeah, I'm being good
No, we ain't partying, it's the TV

Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out all the so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out
Checkin' out

I am going to find a way to love again
I am on the winning stretch of a losing end
Foot on the gas, I am freedom bound
I have got the morning sun at my back, and I am inspired
Nothing can slow me down
She used to get me
I was held back by her memory

Let the highway sing
A song of a new beginning, keep these wheels a spinning
Going to hammer down
While the distant sky is waking, light behind me is breaking
I found a better way, in the form of a Chevrolet

A strange reminder of how I walked a step behind her
Back here in the shadows of an 18-wheeler
Where I am heading I still do not know
But I caught the wind of an AM station
Blaring on my radio
I am not looking back
I never thought I could say that. So


Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

Keep chugging along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chugging along

Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're going to pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there arent no going back


Keep chugging along
Yea keep chugging along

Hey! Whiskey burns me up, wine turns my teeth all red
Tequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head
But let me tell you I'm a real big fan, of ice fishing for them aluminum cans

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger
King of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker

Monday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hardworking man
Responsible, kind of dull, head-down, stick to the plan
But all my buddies know me better than that, get us all together and we start throwing them back

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger
King of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker

As far as I'm concerned, it's the All-American way
Twist the top off, just to cap off the day, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack raring to go
Don't you know I'm a killer karaoke country singer
Top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger, king of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker. Yeah
Place is packed, having a blast
Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind
Then the door swings open, I looked left
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest
There goes my good time
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this
Damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now
Looks like I'll be hanging around
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this
Damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
Maybe one in the back with the sear torn
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor
Cause, I know you're on the dancefloor baby
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this
Damn night, and everything we've ever done
I just wanna forget everything we done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
When I need one

Hey girl. Go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud

And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby you know what to do

Baby, you can crash my party anytime

Me and daddy rides around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We would drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence and roads that is how my story goes

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It is right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie land delight, riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me. It is right here in my dirt road diary

I remember when I turned sixteen; I got a license and some gasoline
There is no curve or a straight away we did not fly down
It was not the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down by the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
Wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk it could tell about us

It is not a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane in my head

Tan legs and some Dixie land delight, riding round, windows down on a summer night
I was there, that was me. It is right here in my dirt road diaries
Just ride around this little town and you will see how I wrote my dirt road diary
Me and daddy'd ride around all day
Shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up
We'd drive for miles and miles
And never once hit blacktop or change the dial
One little country station was all there was
Checking gates, fixing fence rows
That's how my story goes
If you want to know the real me
Just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night, I was there and that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
I remember when I turned sixteen
I got a license and some gasoline
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didn't fly down
If wasn't the boys it was me and her
By fire in a field or down on the river
Every inch of that county was sacred ground
I wish I knew where that old truck was
If it could talk it could tell on us
If you want to know the real me
Just turn the page in my dirt road diary
It's right there for you to see
Every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down on a summer night, I was there
And that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary
It ain't a book underneath my bed
Just a dusty memory lane burned in my head
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight
Ridin' round, windows down feeling right
I was there, that was me
It's right here in my dirt road diary
Just ride around my little town and you'll see
How I wrote my dirt road diary

Baby, what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions every day
I could lean in to hold you
Or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?

Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see!

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?

Baby, do I still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep?
Baby, do I?!

Whoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby

Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?
Baby, do I?

I'm walking down the street, shuffling my feet
Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothing in my way
So I keep rocking along

I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustling around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sitting in the shade soaking up the day
Watching them all roll by


I like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow laying low
Rolling anywhere the wind may blow


I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doing my thing, just doing my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry

I'm just doing my thing

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense


So long my friend
'till we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

Drink a beer, drink a beer

Out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
Andy my 30-06, I'm running out of Miller Lite
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishing one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killeds a twelve pack

Sitting here waiting on a deer, drinking beer and wasting bullets
Aiming at the empties, missing hitting pine trees
It arent my fault them cans keep moving
My baby's on the phone saying baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doing
We'll I've been, sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinking beer and wasting bullets

The only deer I've seen been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
Cause arent no boss calling me horse
Ticking me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Arent seen a big buck but it's been a good day


Sitting here, waiting on a deer
Drinking beer and wasting bullets

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drives
In a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10 you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

It's like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you

I want to tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you, every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard
Would love a good break but they feel it too
Every time I see you, why I got to see you?

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you


Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away, and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Every time I see you, oh yeah

Oh, I'm walking down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you

I don't remember much about that time
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine
Riding the strip, sitting on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had
It was spring break, we were out late
And I thought goodness, for heavens sake
When I saw you
And then I kissed you

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you faded away

I still taste the shots on your lips that night
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body taking off your dress
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess
So if I would have known, I would have held on
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose
Cause I still see you

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you 
 faded away

On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you faded away
You faded away

Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Fast
That's what your parents said when they were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
All you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast
I guess we don't quite understand down here
What makes Him do the things He does
Why some people go so soon
While some grow old
I've learned we're just a step away
And tomorrow might be kind of tough
Nothings promised in this life
All you can do is believe

So it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first
I bet He put you in his window sill
Looking out over this big old world
And I know Heaven sure does love
Having you around
In His eyes we're all the same
But I just gotta think when He saw you
And how perfect and pretty you were
He just couldn't wait

Yeah it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first
Yeah it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite
God picks His favorite
Flowers first
Ridin' down the road listenin' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it
The one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to was
A little "Sweet Home...," "Tuesday's Gone,"
And "Working Man Blues."
Chorus:
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song
Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up
Made me more aware of somethin' deep inside
Somethin' that I have
A life I want to share
And I'll rememebr this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on..
My first love song
Baby... 
Yeah baby

Every morning of every day
I wake up; it is the same ole thing
Fight the traffic, punch the clock
Concrete floors wearing out my shoes
Tired of feeling the way I do
Three more trucks to load, it never stops
They are killing me from nine to five
When it is quitting time, I come alive

Because I got a woman
Who holds me in her arms and understands
A beautiful woman
Who knows how hard it is to be a man
No telling where I would be right now
If she had not been sent down
So I do not have to face this world all by myself
She is my five o'clock angel

Like a branded man down where I work
The company name sewn on my shirt
They can buy my time, but they do not own me
There is more to me than what I do
I have got feelings too
There somewhere else I would rather be
You can have your beer and whiskey sour
I do not need no Happy Hour


No telling where I would be right now
If she had not been sent down
So I do not have to face this world all by myself
She is my five o'clock angel
My five o'clock angel

You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
And you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games

This break-up, make-up,hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me
What am I supposed to do with you

And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
All of these games
Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, just just say "I know."
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
There you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl
The sun is gonna make it's way around again
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend
And there you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, just just say "I know."
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show, and then
There you go
Wrecking my whole world, all fixed up
My goodbye girl
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
And there you go
Wrecking my whole world, one more hello
One more goodbye, girl
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say
Goodbye, girl
The sun is gonna make it's way around again
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend
There you go
Wrecking my whole world, one more hello
One more goodbye, girl, all fixed up
My goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking this is where rednecks come from
She had HOLLYWOOD written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions and I was the man for the job

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old COKE sign
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me"

I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat and thought, "You fool, it could have been love"
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust


Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me
Or am I really seeing what I think I see
The woman of my dreams coming back to me


She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me
Thank God for good directions and turnip greens

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start...

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so damn good"

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even need because it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
Cause you start

Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"

Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite like when you're...

Rocking me, rocking me, gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gonna lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a lone night
I can't help but tell myself, "oh boy you got it so good with this good looking girl"

You're my good looking girl
What's up girl

There's peanut dust and corn husks drifting through the air tonight
The marching band's warming up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

There's a thermos and a water jug rolling around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringing us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
Till it's all done until we're all done

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon coming up in the sky
Combine's cutting in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
It's harvest time

Talk about an uphill battle
2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get a rattle
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good night's sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son or raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Subdivisions creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife that loves him every night
Raising a son or raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer


Here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that ol' half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go farther
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

First time I tied a plastic worm and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old tune tone it
I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it

The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips, I was hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on!

Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it

Hooked on the feeling of a summer in the south
Hooked on the dust flying up from a plow
Hooked on them blue eyes, hair falling down
Hooked on her then, still hooked on her now
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it

Woah, woah
Wo-wooah, mmm

If I could make a living from walking in the woods
You can bet I'd be sitting pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas
I'd be wheeling and dealing and sittin' there reeling 'em in

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

I'd get a little Farm Pond bus
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke, murphy
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

We get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the morning, late in the evening
I'm getting red dirt rich, Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here, knee deep, in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
Lets go there in our mind

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the morning, dark whiskey in the evening
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin', and fishin' and lovin' every day
Come on
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day
Yeah

It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned and two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man I took hold of that can

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do, I did it again

I guess, I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I arent no quitter

The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah, things got out of hand at that party
I said, "That's it, it's 'bout time I grow up"
But that next weekend, I called all my friends

And I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do

Yeah, what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again
I done, done it again, I did it again

You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on

There's a little place down the old road
Nobody but me and the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike, and my blue texan
Spend a lot long summer nights
With the hood out in the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, and let me take you where

I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
When the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!
There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When we join grandma, and the by and by
Got them right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I'd better carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time

I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!

Yeah, I done some barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the big man in the sky

Baby, jump on in, there's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there!

Right there, ha ha ha!

Hey, you want some lunch? I'm buying
Yeah man, I'm starving. What are you getting?
I'll have the falafel plate, please. How about you?
The uh, you know the uh, that thing there

Um, the brown stuff that you, uh, you know, it's...
Man, man I'm good
Are you kidding me? What's going on man, you okay?
Not exactly

I was born in Southwest Georgia
Always tried to make my daddy proud
But of all the things I've learned there
Never learned how to say that word out loud
I just want something to eat
Made with a vertical rotisserie of lamb meat

I think I know just what you're going through
The way they spelled that gosh darn word seems like a trap
It's just lamb meat and other stuff rolled up in a pita
I wish they'd just called it a lamb tzatziki wrap
I could eat a thousand ounces
If I just knew how to pronounce it

Is it gee-ro, jyro, here-o, or yai-ro?
Never been filled with so much doubt
Is it gwy-ro, ga-hee-ro, yurro, or worbtse?
We can safely rule that last one out

I can't believe I don't know how to say
I eat so many that you'd really think I would
Well my friend it looks like we're in a pickle
Actually a pickle on a wrap sounds pretty good
Well always thought I was a pretty cultured dude
Been to the Taj Mahal, the Great Wall, and the Louvre
I'm fluent in Italian and efficient in Croatian
But when it comes to pronunciation of this particular word...
I'm an abomination
]
Is it gyro? Is it gyro? I'll ask my friend from Kairo
He's usually pretty good with this stuff
Or maybe I'll just mumble it when I place my order

Well, uh, how would you pronounce it then?


It is gyro, it is gyro
Now I know it's gyro
The truth is so delicious to find
No more gyro, you're a hero
Cause now I know it's gyro
I finally got some piece of mind
We finally got some piece of mind
]
I'll take one gyro please

Um, can I change that actually
I'd love a shish keabob with a little extra humus

I'm not supposed to want to love you no more
No more cards and flowers, no more knocks on your door
Just forget the perfect love that we had
But I don't know if I can do that
I was so certain baby you were the one
That this was it and all my searching was done
I should admit you don't get used to the fact
But I don't know if I can do that

I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how, I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't know

The things I'm feeling they just won't go away
I see you out and I don't know what to say
My friends all tell me that I oughta be glad
But I don't know if I can do that


Someday somebody, will really love me
And she'll be everything I thought you would be
And all I want to do is love her back
But I don't know if I can do that
I don't know if I can do that

Girl I know I dont know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
Im so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end

Going to cuss the morning when it comes
Cause I know that the rising sun
Aint no good for me
Cause youll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
Theres plenty of gas and the nights still alive

You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end


You got your hands up
Youre rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
Youre singing every song
Im set on cruise control
Im slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
Youre looking so damn hot

And I dont know what road were on
Or where weve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I dont want this night to end
I dont want this night to end
No I dont want this night to end

We got beer, and a tub
And some good looking girls
Dressed to the nights
Looking for a good time
Jacked up trucks
Stacked in thick
White rocks stuck
In the mud grips
And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D
And don't you dare step out on the floor

If you arent here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you arent here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you arent here to party

There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playing a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Looking so fine shaken that thing
In the zydeco cage and purple rain
Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone


If you arent here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you arent here to party
You'll be missing out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Going home alone is
If you arent here to party

Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party

Throw your keys on the bar
You arent driven' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's going to be
Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah whoa
If you arent here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night

The secret way long shadows bleed into the night
The Desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain
I knew you that way
The way that cool mountain water dances down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives into the passion of the pair that takes
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet easing love that makes a woman want to stay
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The holy way that love knows it should never end
The sacred way that stars got sailors home again
Like teardrops know the words to amazing grace
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I knew you that way

I'm going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're going to be there
I'm going to have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't want to make a fool of myself
I know you're going to be there, I know you're going to be there

And I'm going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm going to pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know you're going to be there

You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl, I know you're going to be there
Going to walk right by that table were you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's going to be an accident
I know you're going to be there
I'm going to act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're going to be there

And I'm going to bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm going to pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just want to see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there
I know you're gonna be there

I'm going to put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Truth is when I see you, I don't know what I'll do

T-shirt, blue jeans don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut arent no
Redeye gravy on a biscuit
My deep Southern drawl
Makes the conversation crawl
You're going to have to hang around
Long enough to hear me out
Some folks aren't happy like they are
Some want to take things just a little too far

Singers want to be Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

My granny and pawpaw
Still missing Hee Haw
And I love my little town
Where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street
Got a kiss just waiting on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries
When I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touching her love loving
Hardworking man

Quarterbacks want to play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes
But I still believe
I'm going to make it easy
I'll stay me
Yeah singers want to be
Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

I'll stay me, I'm going to make it easy, I'll stay me

Grabbed my phone, rolled outta bed
Went back through all the texts I sent
Half-drunk beer on my nightstand
And a red club stamp on my right hand
Tripped on my boots walking down the hall
Chugging sink water, staring at the wall
Trying to put the pieces back together again
Who did how, what, where and when?

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
I got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt
All I know is we went out and done it up right
I rode a bull, did a keg stand, shot gunned a beer can, jumped in and broke up a fight
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night

I think I left my debit card at the bar
Think I took a kiss a little too far
Who's that sleeping on my couch?
I got to whole lot of drunk drama left to sort out


Oh hell yeah my head hurts
Now that I come to think about it this arent my shirt
All I know is I went out and done it up right
Got in a fight with my girlfriend, threw down my beer can, and still had the time of my life
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night

Yeah, yeah now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night
Man what a Friday night

It feels like I woke up one morning
And it all changed without warning
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

I talk about being caught off guard
Talk about an old boy falling hard
Think about a few weeks flying by
And talk about losing track of time
Now I'm counting every second until I see her

Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancing on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singing
Or the way it all happened without even thinking
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl

I was cool with hanging around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Saying things I arent never said
And being with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I
Whoa yes I
Yes I'm in love with the girl
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin me up, yeah
Buyin me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing

I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin up there with the band
Takin me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong

Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye

Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin' me up, yeah
Buyin' me drinks
With a thousand girls
There's just one thing
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody
In my head, in the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody
In my head, in the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody
In my head, in the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you

There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room arent ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy
To tote down to the beach all by myself
I'd be willing to bet
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help

But it's a shore thing
The sun will be shinning
On my cold drink
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Having happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight

I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take us out at a bar
Throw a beer on the band
Toss down head into a parking lot road
And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Hugging all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
Cause all I know

It's a shore thing
The sun will be shinning
On my cold drink
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Having happy hour
All day long in the sand


What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rock star
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

What makes a good old boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now

Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

You can chug it down all you want
But you arent going to last long
Trust me you can get there with

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Going to be mm so good, mm so right
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip

Taking one of them big old sips

She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back how it used to be
No, to but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over
It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over
Kick the dust up, c'mon

All week long its a farmin town
Theyre makin that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There aint nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Lets tear it up, up
And kick the dust up 

Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, its packed inside
I dont know what theyre waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And its like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There aint nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Lets tear it up, up
And kick the dust up 

Just follow me down neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did 

We go way out where
There aint nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Thats whats up, up
Lets kick the dust up

High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights


We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know


Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights
Kill the lights

All we do right is make love
And we both know now that aint enough

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Lets do what we do best
I guess everybodys got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby who we are just didnt work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Aint gotta ask you whats wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Lets do what we do best
I guess everybodys got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Aint gonna beg you to stay
Aint gotta ask you whats wrong
Aint no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Lets do what we do best
I guess everybodys got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didnt have to try
Lets lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Lets kiss tomorrow goodbye

I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It dont leave my sight since we had that fight
Cant remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know youre reading your phone
I cant help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick I miss you pictures
Im on your clock, youre in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know youre reading your phone
I cant help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it / I feel the buzz in my bed
And I dont get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

Yeah I've iced down a few thousand beers in my day
To put down twice as many
No telling how many bonfires have lit up my face
If it ain't hundreds, it ain't any
I stood on this stage so many times
And watched all my friends
Have the time of your life
There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...

Like we ain't ever
All been together
And tried to make one night last forever
Once it's gone, you can't get it back
So lift 'em up, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good like we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever

This ain't the first time we've partied under these stars
Making a hangover
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer


There's something in this spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up right...
Let's do it up right...

Drop it boys

I say hey man
What you doing later on?
He said aw man
I'm just hanging out later on
I said I'll swing by and get you
And you'll be there and I bet you
We can find a little something to do a little later on
I say hey man
What's Jr. and them doing later on?
He said aw man
He's got to check on his momma and them later on
So it looks like you and me
So let's ride around and see
If we can find a little bit of trouble a little later on
Come on!

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
Going to find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're going to get on outta here a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Throw it out there, see where it lands
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

I said hey girl
What you doing later on?
She said
I'm getting off work later on
I said call a couple of your friends
Cause me and my buddy Ben
We're going to be back by to get you a little later on
Ha-ha yeah

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
Going to find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're going to get on outta here a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Grab a pretty girl, take her by the hand
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

Meet up with you little bit, little bit, little bit later on
Come on now a little bit, little bit, little bit later on
We're going to break it all down to the break of dawn
A little bit, little bit, little bit later on

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're going to drink up a lot of beer a little later on
We're going to do it up right
All night long
Going to worry 'bout tomorrow a little later on
You know out in the country don't make no plans
Find a little bar with a guitar band
Rocking out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

Lay a little bit of rubber down on some asphalt
50 yard line, better not get a butt call
A little bit later on
Find a little spot right down on the creek bank
Really don't care what your momma and daddy might think
A little bit later on
A little bit later on
Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, "son he's yours from now on"
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old
He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old
He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said "you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home"
"And be a good boy"
"Now you be a good boy"
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

Girl Ill be over there
With my buddies drinking beer
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When youre ready shoot me that smile
That way Ill know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothing like love in a college town

All the rumors fly
Did you hear who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
Theres old whats-his-name
He just cant seem to graduate
Hitting on the new crop, buying them lemon drops
Man thats just wrong!

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town

Im going to fail this test
Thinking bout your dress
Laying on my floor
Running out the door
A-A-B-A-C, that sounds good to me!

We wont ever look as good as we do now
So lets give it one more shot
Baby hows that sound?
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town

Got to love love in a college town
I once thought of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago I made a decision
I once thought of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime
Baby, you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be
Baby, you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree
 Oh yeah, oh yeah
Baby, you left me defenseless
I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty of love in the first degree
Love in the first degree oh yea
Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree oh yea
Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree
Love in the first degree

I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that kissing angel good morning song
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

Why don't you slip into a little something off the secret menu
Kick back, let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
Baby, let me love it gone

Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it gone

Dont need a hotel or a high-rise
A big ol boat with a fancy name
Dont need a backseat
Dont need no rusty truck bed
We can leave that dust on that ol porch swing

Lets get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double-wide
And Im bout to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
Whats that sound like to you?
Cause it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when youre ready to leave

Lets get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Find an old pasture where the cows aint been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes where the flowers grow wild
Little after midnight, morning dew on our skin
Promise you wont nobody, nobody know where weve been

Lets get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass
Lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field

Love me in a field
Love me in a field
In a big ol field

I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believestreets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
And I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playing throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

It flows underneath the 32 bridge
And cuts through the heart of South Georgia
Big copperheads and mean wild pigs
And gators in the weeds waiting for ya
I leave my phone in the truck
I leave my truck at the road
My four-wheeler gets me where I wanna go
I leave the world behind
I pull my hat down low
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

Daddy brought me down here when I was a kid
Taught me how to bait a craw fish basket
From the time I was old enough to walk
He had me running down squirrels and rabbits
I feel right at home in this neck of the woods
If this was all I had, I'd be living good
So let the stock market do what it's gonna do
Let the dollar go down and gas over the roof

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek water

I'm free, and I'm me
Being everything that I wanna be
Nobody jacking with me
No sign of the city lights
Hell with the city lights!

I got an old Jon boat that I stowed down there
On them hot summer nights when I get a-wild hare
I got a moonshine stash in a cypress stump
And a catfish line going - bump bump bump
An old tractor tire where I sit by the fire
And drink to a sweet swamp song
So if you're looking for me, don't even holler
When I get down deep in that Muckalee Creek water
That Muckalee Creek water

Riding down the road listening to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it
The one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to was
A little "Sweet Home," "Tuesday's Gone"
And "Working Man Blues."

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song

Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up
Made me more aware of something deep inside
Something that I have
A life I want to share
And I'll remember this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby 

Yeah baby
My first love song

Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot

No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town

It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco
My ol' Bronco

Where you been hiding all week girl?
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar, in every place
Somehow I miss your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Let's make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
'Fore we say our goodbyes girl

Yeah in the morning you'll be gone, gone, gone
So baby let's just hold on

Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One
Girl we woulda had one hell of a time
If I had met you on night one

Yeah in the morning we'll be gone, gone, gone
Yeah baby that's just wrong

Wish I had met you on night one
What a week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up
Waking up, no we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have
Seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
Slow down, son
I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
Yeah yeah, I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night
You got me all caught up

Or I can turn around, up here, on the right
Ah, just look at this sky
The rain aint far from fallin down
And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do
I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops

Let's go out like that

Its just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
Its like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
Its like you come, come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere?
My little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

Girl, are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend?
All of my life Ive been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I dont wanna leave here alone anymore

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
Its like you come, come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
But do you wanna go somewhere?
My little out of nowhere girl

I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah, we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We could go anywhere you want
Baby. I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby, I saw you

My little out, out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
Its like you come, come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere?
My little out of nowhere girl

I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah, we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl

Out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl
Out of nowhere girl

It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl

Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you

My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Any way you gotta be
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl

My out of nowhere girl
My out of nowhere girl
Out of nowhere girl

There's a bonfire burning
Got Bocephus blaring louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood
If you want to see follow me over the river through the woods
When the bugs and the beer start biting
Theres bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumping up on somebodys hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods

Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights a left then a hard right
They're going all night
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should
Over the river and through the woods

At first I thought she was kidding when she mentioned skinny dipping
She said follow me through the trees yes siree unless I misunderstood
We'll splash and splash with the fish over the river and through the woods

Thats my beer can next to her beer can next to my work pants up there on dry land
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should
Over the river and through the woods

Thats my sore head laying in my truck bed eyes blood shot red hearing what my mamma said
But we did a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should
Over the river and through the woods

Over the river and through the woods

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "no way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here, boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, "oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "come here boy, I wanna dance!"
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "play it again, play it again, play it again"

Yeah play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again
Yea

Time is tight and money's short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Got to figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh Mama, what am I going to do
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything

Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip
And your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh Mama, what am I going to do
She said, "Child, theres only one thing you can do"


Yeah take a walk, take a breath, oh give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple fish
And just like that toss them back and make a little wish

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it stress about it, fret about it
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Yeah, pray about everything

My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Arent nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yea where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing' in a big mud puddle

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing, rain is a good thing

You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded yo
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait

You ain't used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slice you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a fucking razor blade

She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back


She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster

Now she's got me twisted, yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster
Out of all the reindeers
You know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph
Randolph ain't too far behind
Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round
Said Santa to a boy
Child what have you been longing for
All I want for Christmas is a
Rock and roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph
Whizzin' like a shootin' star
Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round
Run like it's stolen
Said Santa to a girl
Child what would please you most to get
A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink, and wet
And then away went Rudolph
Whizzin' like a saber jet
Run run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph
Cause I'm reelin' like a merry go round
Run run Rudolph

Run run Rudolph
Run run run Rudolph

Run run
Run run run Rudolph

Merry Christmas everybody

We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a 2 mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

I don't get back near enough and just like these fields
Yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
Just like the scarecrows

From that first second
I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know I've been going crazy over you
Here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

This can't be no buzz from the salt in the air
I arent never had no drink do me like this, I swear
Feels like I'm spinning around, watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right
Before I hit the lights


So I'll just keep holding on
Loving you all night long

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

From that first second I laid eyes on you
To them kisses morning
To right now in this room
You know I've been going crazy over you
Here we are, again tonight
Holding on, feeling right

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
We win like the tides
Get lost in your eyes
Oh girl
Before you get, to loving on me
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

This can't be no buzz from the salt in the air
I ain't never had a drink
Do me like this, I swear
Feels like I'm spinning around
Watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right
Before I hit the lights


Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Whoa

Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the pool and moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine

She get me high, she get me low
She got the key to this old Bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving, it's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti, on an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Clouds roll by
She get me high

There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room arent ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy
To tote down to the beach all by myself
I'd be willing to bet
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help

But it's a shore thing
The sun will be shinning
On my cold drink
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Having' happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight

I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take a shot on the bar
Throw a beer on the band
Get tossed out on my head
Into a parking lot road
And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Hugging all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
Cause all I know

But it's a shore thing
The sun will be shinning
On my cold drink
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Having' happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight


It's a shore thing
The sun will be shinning
On my cold drink
And I'll be wearing
Is a miller light towel
Holding happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
Yeah it's a shore thing
We'll never remember tonight

She likes to watch him out the window
Goin round in circles under the sun
Somethin bout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookin forward to after hes done
He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standin in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judgin by her smile, its about time to
Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the suns still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
Shut it down
He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkin maybe he oughta just call it a day
Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the suns still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Shut it down
Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittin still
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Close the door, lock it out, lock it out
Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down
Shut it down
She likes to watch him out the window
Goin round in circles under the sun
Somethin bout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookin forward to after hes done
He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standin in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judgin by her smile, its about time to
Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the suns still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
Shut it down
He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkin maybe he oughta just call it a day
Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the suns still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Shut it down
Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittin still
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Close the door, lock it out, lock it out
Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down
Shut it down

How do you turn a scholarship down
Tear up a ticket, already punched
And watch a dream die?
Who is going to tell me how
To face Daddy
And watch Mamma cry?
Have I thrown my future away?
Played my last football game?
It all seems so strange
How in just one night
Your whole life can change

Wish this old John Deere had wings
And this cotton row was an airstrip
Straight out of here
Wish this high noon Georgia sun
Could melt what is been done
Make it disappear
If I could leave, I would be gone
But that is just one more thing done wrong
By this small town favorite son

By fall they are all going to know
Our little secret
My baby holds inside
By then she will be starting to show
And I will be the husband
To a shotgun bride
I already miss that sound
The marching bands and the cheering crowds
Stuck here in this red dirt ground
Knowing I, I let everybody down


That high noon Georgia sun
Cannot melt what is been done
Girl, I will be right here
I do not know much about life
But I know what is right
For this small town favorite son

I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldnt believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

Baby is someone else calling you baby
Its driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye arent never easy
So break it to me hard
If youre over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Dont try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I arent leaving till I hear you say whats going on
Itll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl Im gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
Its driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye arent never easy
So break it to me hard
If youre over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Dont try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

No goodbye arent never easy
So break it to me hard
If youre over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Dont try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, dont try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?

You got your sundress on for game day
Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
My, my, sorority girl
My, my, sorority girl
You got that high school boyfriend
You still think about
You know how to make him jealous
When he comes into town
You drive your little love bug
When you're skipping class
And your sisters get you home
When you're drunk off your ass
You know how to be a lady
Yeah, you're still your daddy's baby
You drive the band and the boys
And the bartenders crazy

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
My, my, sorority girl
My, my, sorority girl
Yeah, you rock this country boy's world
My, my sorority girl
C'mon up on stage
Sing a little song with me

You looked at me like I was crazy
When I said ma'am to that little old lady
You ain't heard talk like that lately
But I can see, it's got you smilin'
And you say you still remember
Our first date me cookin' you dinner
And how I didn't even try to kiss you
At the end of the date
Cause I was raised

Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman

I'm gonna, open up these plantation blinds
To the sun coming up in your pretty blue eyes
Tell you you're beautiful a thousand times a day
'Til your in love with the way that I

Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman

Girl I'm gonna take you on a trip like back in time
Just put your hand in mine, and won't you

Come here when you walk in the door
Let me spin you around this old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Can't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman

It's been a real good run
Playin' out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear you all don't know
What you mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that it's over
It makes me want to spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishin' I was down there with ya
Hanging out, it'll kill me then
But I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

We made this sun tan city
And all of ya'll sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
You all do not know if might sound crazy
But you gonna make my spring break down

Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
Ooo...but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down
Swear I'm about to spring break down

Ya'll up there on them shoulders
Good and bad hangovers
I'm about to spring break down

It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl
And she was bird-dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her straight in the eye

It was a spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You arent from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

No I don't need your number
Don't want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to you
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy, well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You arent from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye

Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that old beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You arent from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up

Spring break-up
Baby don't cry
You arent from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, lets dont talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, well remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
Its time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They aint holdin nothin these two hands
Until theyre holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I dont wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Lets get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down...

I hear you found one
Heard he's a good one
Livin out all your dreams
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me
When it don't work out
And then he walks out
Before you look for number 3
Stop for a second
Maybe you'll reckon
You shoulda just stuck with me

I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you

I keep on hoping
You had to go just so you could spread your wings
But come some sunrise
You'll come to realize
You shoulda just stuck with me


We're gonna look back
We're gonna laugh bout
Our ups and downs and in betweens
When you said goodbye and then you realized
Shoulda just stuck with me
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me
Back again in the back of this pasture
Sweatin' bad in the cab of this tractor
I oughta be worried about the rain
The last hundred rows could've been a little straighter
Guess I'll be hittin' them again later
I could turn this red dirt all day, yeah
Dreamin' 'bout sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Behind the dust is a big ol' blue sky
Kinda reminds me of those blue eyes smilin' back at me
I slide up a gear and go a little faster
Just a little breeze and I'm right back there
And I can almost feel
Her sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Oh, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And one sweet, sweet memory of layin' on the beach
With her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips


It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumping
Little hip-hop something
I was stirring up a coke and crown
Didn't even check in the room
We went straight for the beach
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt
Now I'm scouting my spot
Where we were going to rock
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

Now I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand

Hey there cutie with a Kentucky cozy
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?

Yea I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching' these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

They keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand

I got to buddy who blew all his money
And he had to stay his broke-ass home
He's been going crazy, blowing up my phone
Wanting to know whats going on

I tell him I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
Got the best view in the world
Spending my days catching these rays
Watching coconut covered girls

And they keep strolling by
And they keep rolling in
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, I'm sitting pretty in Suntan City
With a cold one in my hand


Sitting pretty, right here in Suntan City

It was two shades of brown, scratched-up plastic
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches
And his last name engraved in black
Right there by the handle on the top
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon
Lug it down the bank with my arm dragging
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box

Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to Grandma, crying on the dock
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

He'd bait my hook and keep on telling stories
'Bout nickel Cokes, girls, and sandlot glories
Pickup trucks and golden fields
Long before this town knew blacktop

I was almost riding with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Taking turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Filling the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holding on to one wish
That God above could let me borrow Grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish

And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to Grandma, crying on the dock
He'd open up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box

Everything he loved he kept locked up in that old tackle box
It was two shades of brown scratched up plastic

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That Im down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then Ill tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I ain't sure where it all began
Somewhere 'round here I know
This bridge was a little more crowded then
I was playing her a tailgate show
And now Im just sitting here alone

To catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That Im down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then Ill tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

Damn that AM radio
For playing more than a song
My heart wont beat if the strings are broke
The melodys hitting me wrong
Right here where she belongs

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That Im down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then Ill tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

The crickets heard my story and I listened to them sing
I guess Ill close the tailgate up
There arent no telling what tomorrow might bring
Maybe me and a Dixie cup
But that wont be enough

Yes I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That Im down and I ain't alright

I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets want to know then Ill tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues

I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I lose my cool in the open and it shows
That Im down and I ain't alright

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But 1 turned to 10 and 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I cant find my keys for all this parking lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
Cause my ex-girlfriend arent looking half bad

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
"Help me up, aw put me back down put me back down"

I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think its time I call it quits

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yea its time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, cant find my cell phone
Yea my lips all bust and my buzz is gone
Its time to take my drunk ass home
If y'all agree, then sing along
Its time to take, my drunk ass home

"Oh somebody call me a cab, please"

Rocks bang together
Things start blowing up
Planets all align around a big red sun
Then we're all here
That don't just happen
Two tiny sails collide
Then she feels a kick
Soon the baby cries and your going home with him
Then he says daddy
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Crops are in the field
There arent no rain nowhere
Ground is cracks and dust
The whole town is in despair
Then a farmer prays and the storms roll in
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen


Oh, You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Every time we take a deep breath
And every time that the wheels touchdown
Every time we take another step
And have one more day to hang around
Know we didn't get that lucky
Cause that don't just happen
That don't just happen

Someone picked you out
Put you in front of me
In a smoky college bar
The rest is history
That don't just happen

I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, thats my kind of night!

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country right hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, thats my kind of night!
Yeah, thats my kind of night!

My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, thats my kind of night!

Yeah, thats my kind of night!
Thats my kind of night!
Yeah, thats my kind of night!
Come on
There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finaly ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
That's what country is
Chorus
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is
Chorus
It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with

Homecoming parade, you were the queen
I was riding right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids, and I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me, I thought God I'm a lucky man

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together through one more spring
Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat with tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant for wearing Sunday clothes

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
Oh my sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I pulled her into my ride
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning off my credit card
She was burning cars out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

Oh well looks like I've done it again
I ruined another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City
Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Y'all drink one with me
Oh, cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need
Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach

We met down at the floating dock
She snuck out scared, she might get caught
We were nervous, but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms it finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tan lines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said "I'd better go"
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was, I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
T-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

We were too damn young to know any better

Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back

Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back

Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moon shine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back

We've been up here in this city
Living in the grease and grime
Girl, it's a doggone pity
We aint been getting anytime
I've been preaching 'bout back home
How it can make you feel so alive
Tell you what we can do
Baby, let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Aint hearing nothing such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walking 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

There aint no card in your pocket
If we're going to turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like a coke from a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how Miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wrecking my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Aint hearing nothing such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walking 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

Pine straw in your hair
And not an ounce of makeup on you
As the sun goes down
Girl, I aint never seen you looking so good
As you do right now

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby, take my arm
Aint hearing nothing such a beautiful sound?

We can take the tractor down the road
Go walking 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah, yeah

Right there's and old step side
How 'bout that blue sky?
So pretty it'll make you cry

We can roll on over yonder
Or sit right here and ponder
Watch the wind whirl by

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
Wide-eyed, baptized, and still wanting to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

That's us, hauling hay in the field with the radio on
That's us, heading straight into town when the work was done
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago

We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was hunting and fishing and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed, in our lives
Falling in and out of love, we rode in trucks

That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now, riding down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago, it's a part of my soul. Yeah

Down where I was born, was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
Seventeen, we owned those streets
Parking lot, that was our spot
Thats where wed always meet
And wed roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
Wed light the midnight up

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go round
Nothin but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
All the girls next door
Theyd meet us out there
They couldnt wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before theyd leave
Guess they thought we were cool because
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go round
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didnt know nothin'
But we knew everything

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go round
Nothin but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
High five and look around
Damn right, we run this town
Man, I love this town
Come on

There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darling pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter dripping off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair sucking in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
That's what country is

It arent a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss
It arent a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slipping from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole waving at the riverboats
And when they're gone, take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It arent a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
Two kids getting caught stealing a Boone's farm kiss
It arent a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
That's what country is

It arent a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no-cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sun-burnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's something you're born with
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
Girl, there ain't no way you don't know
How pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows
The trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back
I sent your way
I shoulda just took a shot of warm whiskey
And called it a day
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you
I spent half the day all hungover
The morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up, baby
It'd be another week of this
I keep prayin' that you mighta left something
Something when you get undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you
Oh, I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all the heaven and hell
That you put me through
What is it with you
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
What is it with you
Oh, what is it with you

People talkin' bout what is and what aint country
What gives em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin on the rain
Were all a little different, but were all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia  pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Where you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear in on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kinda country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

We've been getting beat up by this old life
Seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night and sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday
I got a bunch of buddies I arent seen in a while
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile
With some home brew
Malibu and Miller Lite
Girl put on that short little party dress
And make me a little bit Jealous
Its going to be a wild weekend
Been on the phone with all my friends
Theres a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high
Long as the keg dont float and the ice dont melt
Well loosen up a notch on the Bible belt

Girl you can bet well fall in love again and again and again
Its going to be a wild, wild, wild weekend

It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, cell phone's singing that
All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight
Bad to the bone ringtone, come on, come on, come on
Baby let's get gone
It's bumper to bumper in the outbound
And we're already getting down
Its going to be a wild weekend
Been on the phone with all my friends
Theres a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high
Long as the keg dont float and the ice dont melt
Well loosen up a notch on the Bible belt

Aw put on the short little party dress
Make me a little bit jealous
Get me thinking goodness
Its going to be a wild weekend, been on the phone with all my friends
Theres a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high
Long as the keg dont float and the ice dont melt, well loosen up a notch on the Bible belt

Girl you can bet well fall in love again and again and again
Its going to be a wild, wild, wild weekend
It's going to be a wild, wild, wild weekend. Yeah

We been needing this for a long, long time
O my baby sure is looking fine
What's up man? How youll been? Throw me a ski rope
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        

One pool hall and a rundown cotton gin
"Come Back Soon" hand painted on a grain bin
We got a hardware store at the intersection
Dirt roads running in all directions
I love this place
But I got to go
Because she is gone

You will can have this town
And what I do not grab on my way out
Because the only thing I need
Is not here. She is gone and found her way
To another life in a better place
But I hear she is missing me
You will can have this town

Bet there is not a single place to fish up there
No small talk or sweet tea, but I do not care
It is going to be worth everything I have to leave
When I feel her loving arms on me
Right there is the Interstate
And I am turning on
Looks like I am gone

Everybody says I will be back
Brother do not hold your breath on that
Because as long as she is not here


My shoulder still burns
My head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on strong, you're crying out
I paint it in my rear view
My speaker still blasts that song
That you turn me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause you and the beach follow me home
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
Is like we never even say good bye
It dont feel like you are really gone
You and the beach follow me home

He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walking off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"

But you don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearing Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma
She said I couldn't stay
And buddy if you're wondering
How could I throw it all away"

You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

If you never felt the fire
Running through your veins
If you've never seen the devil
Face to face

You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack

You and your Sunday mornings
Me and my Saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lacing cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do, yeah

'Cause I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm dust that spins
And the gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You and your stain glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet beauty
Me and my can't sit still

'Cause I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm dust that spins
And the gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

Girl, I'm hell up here on a high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm dust that spins
And the gust of wind
That's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You look like rain

You look like rain
Ye-yeah
You look like rain
You look like rain
You must be rain...

You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day
Tell you how Im going to take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why Im always running away
I dont know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you til you feel the truth
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why Im always running away
I dont know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

Well I never met a girl like you
Thats got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to
Baby you make me want to

Standing right there, awake and aware
I heard the words right off your lips
The meaning was clear, I saw the tears
But somehow the message did not click
The losing you part, the break in my heart, just did not stick

Girl your goodbye was not good enough
I am as into you as I ever was
If you had done it right, then why should not I love
Must be because, your goodbye was not good enough

Some look in your eye, says there is still time
Maybe there is one more last chance left
What you did not say, when you turned away
Made me hang on by one more thread
That shadow of hope, that whisper of smoke, is still in my head

Girl your goodbye was not good enough
I am as into you as I ever was
If you had done it right, then why should not I love
Must be because, your goodbye was not
Good enough to make me see, I do not need you, and you do not need me

Just a little taste won't hurt at all
But once I get a sip, I know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone, all gone
90 proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey
Girl, you got a smile like a devil on my shoulder
Tempting me sayin', honey come over right now, right now
I know I shouldn't wanna, but I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be wakin' up hurtin' in the morning
Shoulda come with a warning
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah, and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I'm addicted girl, I'm hangin; on
I'm a fool in love, I'm long past gone
Yeah, so, come on
Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Oh, and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby, your mama should've named you whiskey
I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy

He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her

The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"

But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want?"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American"

Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl, all-American girl
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Twas Grace have brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
I believe in things unseen
I believe in the message of a dream
I believe in what you are
Because you loved me
With all my heart
And all my soul
I'm loving you
And I never will let go
And everyday I let it show
Because you loved me
Oh and now that you're in my life
I am so glad I'm alive
Because you showed me the way
And I know now how good it can be
Because you loved me 

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

That I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

Cause I dug my key into the side of his
Pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Oh, before he cheats
I set out on a narrow way
Many years ago
Hoping I would find true love
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you
Every long-lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true...
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes, He did
I think about the years I spent
Just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost
I'd give it back to you!
But you just smile
And take my hand
You've been there
You understand
It's all part of a grander plan
That is coming true!
Every long-lost dream
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true...
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true...
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes, He did
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til theres nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til theres nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Theres not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
Theres not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til its all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til theres nothing left standing
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

What you are going to do with the 36 cents
Sticky with coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk bench trying to keep warm
Do you call her over, hand her the change
Ask her story, ask her name
Or do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

What you are going to do when you are watching TV
And an ad comes on, yeah, you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day, you could save a life
Do you call the number, reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam
Do you tell yourself

"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Do not listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, do not listen to them when they say
"You're just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

The world is so big, it can break your heart
And you just want to help, not sure where to start
So you close your eyes
And send up a prayer into the dark

"You are just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Do not listen to them when they say
"You are just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"
Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, do not listen to them when they say
"You are just a fool, just a fool to believe you can change the world"

I need something strong tonight
I'm needing me a 100-proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you

Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're looking in my eyes, but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

Yeah, the grass ain't always greener
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design

Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in a sad place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love of the game
It's the get what you want and then you throw it away
It's the rush of the fall, not the land
It's the catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doing me any kind of favors tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and Bobby Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for naught on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare

But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair 
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere 

Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air

She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hair trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair 
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere 

Well, I do not deny I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear

But there's no body, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair 
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware , yeah yeah-yeah
Hey, yeah

Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We would live or die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

But the foreman of the jury told me "honey, don't you worry"
It's a Choctaw county affair, yeah

Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair , yeah
How would you know cause you weren't there 
It's just a Choctaw County affair 
Mmm, yeah, yeah 

Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong, she's right

Ring ring, telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry


And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away

Head's scared, heart broke
Burned from a band of gold
Rather just be alone

Bang bang on a drum
You're not a setting sun
You ain't even close to done


The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right
Kiss me goodnight

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah


Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away

You better take it from me, that boy is like a disease
You're running, you're trying, you're trying to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You want to get out but he's holding you down
Because you can't live without one more touch

He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
Looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again
'Cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends
You can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you want to believe
But you won't be deceived
If you listen to me
And take my advice

He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
Looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

Run, run away
Don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you want to hear
He'll break your heart
It's just a matter of time
But just remember

He's a good time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
Looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the Devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

Oh, you better run for your life 

Hello you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom
There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

I stood at the bottom of some walls I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
Think that it's all gonna slip away
Hold on, hold on

Here's to you free souls, you firefly chasers
Tree climbers, porch swingers, air guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers, shaking walls in your bedrooms
There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you, just like you
Yeah

I've met some go-getters
Some difference makers
Small town heroes, and big chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove
Oh, yeah

Here's to you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, and dashboard drummers
Here's to you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom
There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Yeah

Oh he gave up on arrows a long, long time ago
Turns out I'm too hard to hit so he put away his bow
I might just keep on running from here to Timbuktu
Cause he gave up on arrows and I am not bulletproof

Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me

He's sitting in that tree stand and his wings are camouflage
I'm dug down in my foxhole waiting on his next barrage
Must be open season, got a target on my back
Think he's throwing love grenades and I'm under attack

Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me, yeah

Well he's got me in his sights, I've got a red dot on my chest
But little does he know I strapped on my Kevlar vest
I pulled out my Remington and I loaded up these shells
He's about to find out I'm a dang good shot myself

Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun aiming at my heart
I've been dodging bullets, I've been hiding in the dark
Sawed-off double barrel, trigger happy as could be
Cupid's got a shotgun and he's pointing it at me
Yeah Cupid's got a shotgun
But right now he's running from me, wooh

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry





18 years have come and gone
For momma they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Momma kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
She took my hand and said
"Baby, don't forget:

Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me"

This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday I called momma up last night
And even when it is not, I tell her everything is alright
Before we hung up I said
"Hey mamma, don't forget
To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
And I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me"

Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But "Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old world
Yeah, I know there are more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me"

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear

Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear

A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know


In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know

A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say

Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say

The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

He will bring us goodness and light

That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the Earth stood still
You said we don't have to, I said I will, yeah
We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don't want to watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside 'fore it was too late

Oh I, Oh I, I'm not even trying
Oh I, Oh I, but I can't stop smiling, yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you, yeah?

I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters 'til the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It's funny how he used to sing it, too
But he was always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me


Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Oh, yeah

Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could have been like
When you're sitting there drinking coffee
Are you thinking of me
When it's thundering and raining outside?
Oh I, oh I, I'm not even trying
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smiling
Oh I, oh I, it's sending me flying
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smiling, Yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me?

Storybook endings, fairy tales coming true
Deep down inside we want to believe they still do
In our secretest heart, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all want to make it too

Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away

Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
Unafraid, unashamed
There is a joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you
Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart

Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after

No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through

To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after


Oh, for ever ever after

I'm flat on the floor
With my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh, lord
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet, when I'm already on my knees

Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby tell me how
You think you gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep coming around
Creeping up my street
Oh boy, you can't bother me

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all blows through
I ain't gonna raise my body
'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign to you

Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

I'm flat on the floor
With my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Oh
Don't knock on my door
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

She remembers the nights hed come calling
His yellow-silk tie
In love she saw him falling for her in the fire of July
Then one day as the nights grew longer
Blackberry winter in a little white church
Stood a young pretty bride

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever changed

She remembers the change in her body
The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind
Then one night as the days grew longer
That Indian summer
She brought love into the world
Cried and held me then

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever child
Forever changed

Some days shell talk about aunt Rosie
The sister she lost
Asking when shes coming over
And why she hasnt called
Some days I just hold her fragile hand
As time creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me
Watching her memories slip away a little more

Forever changed
Forever changed
Nothing ever stays the same
Forever named
Forever child
Forever loved
Forever changed

Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on, we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost I'll be good with that
Yeah we'll find a way to make the time pass
Window rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holding my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All of our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Yeah, let's just get out of this town
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

Hey, good girl
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you
What youre thinking about
You'll see a good boy
Going to give you the world
But hes going to leave you crying
With your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey
But hell sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and
Go and throw away the key
Hey good girl
Get out while you can

Hes no good, girl
No good for you

I heard you laughing in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
I caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
It took me back
You looked happy with that little girl up on your shoulders, happy
I know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
Times been sweet to you

As bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didnt get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When youre holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday youll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah, sometimes, theres good in goodbye

I dont regret it
The time we had together
I wont forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah Im happy
I found somebody too who makes me happy
And I knew one day Ill see you on the street
And itd be bittersweet

But as bad as it was, as bad as it hurt
I thank God I didnt get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads you down a different road
When youre holding on to someone that you got to let go
Someday youll see the reason why
Yeah, sometimes, yeah sometimes, theres good in goodbye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As bad as it was, yeah, as bad as it hurt

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd
Oh, but I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, baby we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, what are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beating faster in your chest

And tonight I wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel
Left all alone

Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long & winding road

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

You know that I've seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights, falling off
The silver screen

My hearts like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

Um, I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah... I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!


When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"

How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Where 69 meets 40
There is a single stop light town
And back when I was really young
A part of that burned down
On any given Friday night
We would drive a hundred miles
Between the Sonic and the Grocery Store
Laughing all the while
With as many friends as I could pack
In my daddy's Ford
But I ain't in Checotah anymore
My hotel in Manhattan
Holds more people than our town
And what I just paid for dinner
Would be a down payment on a house
I would rather be tipping cows in Tulsa
Than hailing cabs here in New York
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I am in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind

In a world of long red carpets
The bright lights of Hollywood
All the paparazzi flashing
Could make a girl feel pretty good
You can get anything you want here
Except a Wal-Mart store
But I ain't in Checotah anymore

I am in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind

Where the Wildcats beat the Iron heads
Old Settler's day and the Okra Fest
After prom, down at the bowling lanes
Catching crappie fish in Eufaula lake
I ain't in Checotah anymore

I am in a world so wide
It makes me feel small sometimes
I miss the big blue skies
The Oklahoma kind
But I am not in Checotah
No I am not in Checotah
Oh, There is nothing like Oklahoma

Where 69 meets 40
There is a single stoplight town
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Lovin' might be a mistake
But it's worth making
Don't let some hell bent heart
Leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above
More than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
I hope you dance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance


I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I hope you dance

I hope you dance


I hope you dance


I hope you dance



Lately nothing I do ever seems to please you
And maybe turning my back would be that much easier
Because hurtful words are all that we exchange
But I cannot watch you walk away
Can I forget about the way it feels to touch you?
And all about the good times that we have been through
Could I wake up without you every day?
Would I let you walk away?

No, I cannot learn to live without
And I cannot give up on us now

Oh, I know I could say we are through
And tell myself I am over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I would fail Because I, I just cannot live a lie

Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?
And all the reasons that make loving you so easy
The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe
The way you know just what I mean

No, I cannot learn to live without
Oh, so do not you give up on us now

Oh, I know I could say we are through
And tell myself I am over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I would fail Because I, I just cannot live a lie
Oh, and I do not want to try

Oh, I know I could say we are through
And tell myself I am over you
But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I would fail Because I, I just cannot live a lie
I just cannot live a lie

But even if I made a vow
I promise not to miss you now
And try to hide the truth inside
I would fail Because I, I just cannot live a lie

Oh, I cannot live a lie
Oh, I cannot live a lie

I know you don't mean to be mean to me
'Cause when you want to you can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately you make me feel all I am is a back-up plan
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget
Everything I said
I buy into those eyes
And into your lies

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

I wish you were where you're supposed to be
Close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
And still no sound
Of footsteps on my stairs
Or your voice anywhere

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
I'll be home for Christmas

Oh why you look so sad
The tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Dont be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause Ive seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

Ill stand by you
Ill stand by you
Wont let nobody hurt you
Ill stand by you

So if you're mad get mad
Dont hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well Im a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong

Ill stand by you
Ill stand by you
Wont let nobody hurt you
Ill stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And Ill never desert you
Ill stand by you

And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

Ill stand by you
Ill stand by you
Wont let nobody hurt you
Ill stand by you
Take me in into you darkest hour
And Ill never desert you
Ill stand by you

Oh Ill stand by you
Ill stand by you

Well she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losing end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no was about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky the 4th of July
By the time that the fireman came
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain't saying it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day


I have been down
Now I am blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it is right, it is so amazing
Everytime I see you I am alive
You are all I have got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

I want to be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I want to be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you are breathing in
A soothing wind
I want to be inside your heaven

When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes


When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I will still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I want to be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

I want to be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away
I want to be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you are breathing in
A soothing wind
I want to be inside your heaven
Oh yes I do
I want to be inside your heaven

Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling
Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned

Would you say I told you so
Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so
But you had to go
Now I found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

Now I found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It had been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cannot do this on my own
I am letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I am on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I am sorry for the way
I have been living my life
I know I have got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I cannot do this on my own
I am letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I am on
Jesus take the wheel

Oh, I am letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I am on
From this road I am on
Jesus take the wheel

Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, oh

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know

Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now

Oh, this is just a dream

Oh this is just a dream
This is just a dream
Yeah yeah
Deserts grow cold
Rivers run dry
We give up on each other without thinking twice
Hope gets lost
Can't see the dawn
When the storm just won't let up, give us the faith to carry on
When we get scared
Let this be our prayer
God keep us safe, safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
We walk a thousand steps in the wrong direction
Broken and bruised, wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on
Trying to get back home
And through the struggles and the troubles I know we don't walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed
God keep us safe, safe tonight
And keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
God keep us safe
Oh God keep us safe
Unafraid
And keep our eyes on the heavens and give us grace
Send us an army of angels
To make us brave
Keep us strong and unafraid
Keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
And keep us safe

Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
And I don't even know his last name

We left, the club, 'bout around 3 o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot, well it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh where did my manners go?

I don't even know his last name
Oh My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into "oh no, what have I done"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go

Today, I woke up, thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

I don't even know my last name
Oh My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "hey cutie where you from"
And then it turned into "oh no, what have I done"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done
What have I done
What have I done
Oh, what have I done
I don't even know my last name
Well it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Yea, Yeah, Yeah

I don't even know my last name
It started off "hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah
Last night I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby

And I had no clue what I was gettin into so I blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?
And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey cutie, where are you from?"

Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think its real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

Oh, oh, yeah
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
I just cant leave love alone
Hey!

Isnt it funny how love can make you fly

Oh, I cant stop it
Oh, got to have it, want it

There are some things that I regret
Some words I wish had gone unsaid
Some starts
That had some bitter endings
Been some bad times I have been through
Damage I cannot undo
Some things
I wish I could do all, all over again
But it do not really matter
Life gets that much harder
It makes you that much stronger
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wondered how I would get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I am thankful, for every break in my heart
I am grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned

There are mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads
I never should have taken
Been some signs I did not see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds
That I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it do not make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you are given
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
Everyday I wondered how I would get through the night
Every change, life has thrown me
I am thankful, for every break in my heart
I am grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned

And all the things that break you
Are all the things that make you strong
You can't change the past 
And you just got to move on
Because it's all
Lessons learned

And every tear that had to fall from my eyes
From every day I wondered how I would get through the night
From every change, life has thrown me
I'm thankful, for every break in my heart
I'm grateful, for every scar
Some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Oh, some pages turned
Some bridges burned
But there were lessons learned
Lessons learned

You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's OK, we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair, baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah, you look like nothing but mine

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again

Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch, every whisper, let go

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Ooh, yeah
I wanna love you like the rain on a roof
Stronger than a bottle of 110 proof
I wanna take love to places that love has never been
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
And I'll love you again
Oh, and again

Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing Ring Around The Rosie in a picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Coloring her lips red in her bedroom

Prom queen wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before

Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Ooh, yeah

Sometimes I wish I could just go back and say
"Take your time and let it last, little girl"

Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's saying, she's praying

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

No smoke, no bullets, no kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done

Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue


Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

No smoke, no bullets, no kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done

Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue


Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

No smoke, no bullets, no shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done

Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

Toy guns
Oh like little toy guns

I would bet my life, like I bet my heart
That you were the one, baby
I've never been so sure of anything before
You're driving my heart crazy
I can't hold out, I can't hold back now
Like I've done before

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see?
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm in too deep
Then I fall a little further
Every time you look at me

How do you do that, babe?
Make me feel like I'm the only girl alive for you
I don't know what it is that makes me fall like this
The first time in your arms, I knew
The way you held me, I knew that this could be
What I've been waiting to find

Darling, look at me
I've fallen like a fool for you
Darling, can't you see?
I'd do anything you want me to

I tell myself I'm getting in too deep
Then I fall a little further
Every time you look at me

Every time you look at me

Mama you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You have given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what is best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes

And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

And when I watch my baby grow up
I only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say

And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No, he's never gonna leave
So, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Mama, don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life
And I know you watched me grow up
And only want what's best for me
And I think I've found the answer to your prayers
And he is good, so good
He treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
Mama, there's no way you'll ever lose me
Giving me away is not goodbye
As you watch me walk down to my future
I hope tears of joy are in your eyes
'Cause he is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me
And when I watch my baby grow up
I'll only want what's best for her
And I hope she'll find the answer to my prayers
And that she'll say....
He is good, so good
And he treats your little girl like a real man should
He is good, so good
He makes promises he keeps
No he's never gonna leave
So don't you worry about me
Don't you worry about me

Red sun, saltwater dripping, haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara, chains
We ain't alone

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Look for the golden sombrero
Puerto Nuevo West
Blondes have a little too much fun
I'll be brunette
Adis til then

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky

Nobody ever told you

You shine like a diamond
Glitter like gold

Mirror mirror on the wall
Acting like it knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity

O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night, O Night, O night divine!
O night, O Night, O night divine!
O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born;
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!

If youre tired of your life and the way that you feel
Like a fish on a hook
Like a bug on a dirty windshield, its ok
Its time to take your chips and cash them all in
Cause it matters where youre going
Not where you been, say hey
Goodbye yesterday
Well if life dont go your way
Maybe its time to take a break
Yeah, yeah

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, uh, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket

So pack up your smile and your new flip flops
Were headed to a heaven where the beat dont stop
We'll dance the day and the night away
Grab yourself a gal
Grab yourself a fella
Grab yourself a drink with a pink umbrella
Goodbye yesterday
Whenever life don't go your way
Well, maybe it's time to take a nice long break

Raise your hands in the air tonight
Put a little love back in your life
Get your feet up, and just kick it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Sun's shining bright and it's meant for us
Life is like a ride on a party bus
Turn the radio up and sing along with it, hey
We got a one way ticket
Ooh la la la la la la la la

So raise your hands in the air tonight
Raise your hands in the air tonight, whoa
Punch that clock and call it a day
Say adios to the minimum wage
Tell your boss man where he can stick it, hey

Life is so good, its sticky sweet
Its a carnival cotton candy treat
Unwrap it like a lollipop, lick it, hey
We got a one way ticket

O la la la la la la la
Whoa-oh-oh
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm oh

What you gonna do when the show is over?
What you gonna sing when the song ends?
How you gonna cope when there is no closure?
Where you gonna reach when the goal gets higher?
How you gonna make it through
When you think you lost your chance?

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even when the floodgates swing wide open
Never let the current sink you down, no
Even when you're not sure where you're going
Swimming through a mess and you can't get out
Just going through the motions, trying not to drown

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on

Even through a storm on the darkest night
Don't you ever give up the fight
Even when you feel you are all alone
Play on, play on

Play on when you're losing the game
Play on 'cause you're gonna make mistakes
It's always worth the sacrifice
Even when you think you're wrong
So play on, play on
Play on

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but well take our chances
Cause God stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
And turned his back
And all Gods children
Crept out the back door
And its hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging onto hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say its much too late
Oh maybe we should all be praying for time

This is the year of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

These are the days of the guilty man
The television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there
Is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But Ill take my chances cause God stopped keeping score
And youll cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Cause he has no children
To come back for

And its hard to love when there's so much to hate
And hanging onto hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say its much, much too late
Mm, well maybe we should all be praying for time

Here is how it goes
Boy meets girl, girl leaves boy
That is all I know
All I have done, all my life
Because throughout my history
I have only been with jerks
Who could not take it
But you see the picket fence
A swing on the front porch
With us two on it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever want to give you up
Till now, I have always been a quitter

You rescued me
Saved my life just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try
Because oh, the way you are kissing me
Makes it hard to breathe
But I still like it
Oh oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever want to give you up
Till now, I have always been a quitter

I have always been a quitter

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever want to give you up
Till now, I have always been a quitter

I have always been a quitter

If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I can quit when I'm ready 
I ain't hurting nobody but me

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just some wine that I'm tasting

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
 
We didn't care if people stared
We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
Somebody'd tell us to get a room
It's hard to believe that was me and you
Now we keep saying that we're okay
But I don't want to settle for good not great
I miss the way that it felt back then I want to feel that way again

 Been so long that you'd forget
The way I used to kiss your neck
 Remind me, remind me
 So on fire so in love
Way back when we couldn't get enough
 Remind me, remind me
 
Remember the airport dropping me off
We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
 I felt bad because you missed your flight
 But that meant we had one more night
 
Do you remember how it used to be
We'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep
 Remind me, baby, remind me

Oh, so on fire so in love
That look in your eyes that I miss so much
 Remind me, baby, remind me

 I want to feel that way
 Yeah, I want to hold you close

Oh, if you still love me
Don't just assume I know
 Baby, remind me, remind me

 Do you remember the way it felt?
 You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
 Remind me
 Yeah, remind me

All those things that you used to do
That made me fall in love with you
Remind me, oh, baby, remind me
 
Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
All those mornings I was late for work
Remind me
 Oh, baby, remind me

 Oh, baby, remind me, baby, remind me
 Yeah, you'd waked up in my old T-shirt
 Remind me, yeah, oh
 Baby, remind me

Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Looks like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away

You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah but take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset
With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Oh baby, run away

Young gunslinger makin' new amends
Tough as nails under that corset
Call her renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away
She's a renegade

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I wont cry
Cause I know Ill never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

Ill see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

Ill see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know
Ill see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah yeah

Ill see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone

She's a small-town, hard-working woman
Just trying to make a living
Working three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you never taking nothing and doing nothing but giving
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

He's a big-city, hard-working man just trying to climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of driving a tractor
Never had nothing handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do something good that matters

He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"

So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go

One foot on the bus, about half past nine
I knew that you were leaving this time
I thought about laying down in it is path
Thinking that you might get off for that
I remember that night we laid in bed
Naming all our kids that we hadn't had yet
One for your grandma and one for mine
Said we would draw straws when it came time

I will move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship do not need her moon
It will break my heart but I will get through
Someday when I stop loving you

I bet all I had on a thing called love
I guess in the end it wasn't enough
And it is hard to watch you leave right now
I'm gonna have to learn to let you go somehow
Somehow

I will move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship do not need her moon
It will break my heart but I will get through
Someday when I stop loving you

Ooh
Oh, someday
Yeah, someday

I will move on baby just like you
When the desert floods and the grass turns blue
When a sailing ship do not need her moon
It will break my heart but I will get through
Someday when I stop loving you

Someday when I stop loving you

I have never been the kind that you would call lucky
Always stumbling around in circles
But I must have stumbled into something
Look at me
Am I really alone with you?
I wake up feeling like my life is worth living
Cannot recall when I last felt that way
Guess it must be all this love you are giving
Never knew
Never knew it could be like this
But I guess

Some hearts
They just get all the right breaks
Some hearts have the stars on their side
Some hearts
They just have it so easy
Some hearts just get lucky sometimes
Some hearts just get lucky, lucky sometimes

Now who would have thought someone like you could love me
You are the last thing my heart expected
Who would have thought I would ever find somebody
Someone who someone who makes me feel like this
Well I guess

Even hearts like mine
Get lucky, lucky sometimes
Even hearts like mine
Oh
 

He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door"
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth."
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better."
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm

Changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm

Changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger
There must be something in the water 
Oh, there must be something in the water 
Oh, there must be something in the water 
Oh, there must be something in the water 
Oh, yeah

I am changed
Stronger

Was blind but now I see

All the raindrops
In the sky tonight
Can't compare with all the pain
And all the tears I've cried
But now I'm done

All the make believe
Locked in this picture frame
Is gonna stay behind
Along with all the burning rage
That's been tearing through my heart
It killing me slowly
Every beat, I was falling apart

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

All this time I've spent
Staring at the door
I never had the strength
To pack my bags and leave before
But now I'm done
Lying to myself when it's clear
That you're not that one

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

When there's nothing left
For me to leave behind
And you're already too far gone
To say goodbye

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

Sometimes you leave

Want to find some boy, rip his heart right out
First man I see, got to take him down
It is not the Christian thing to do, they say
But someone, somewhere is got to pay

And if it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this
And if you had not gone and done me wrong
I would not go off like this
Yeah, even I am surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this

Broke my TV, pawned my guitar
After maxing out my credit cards
You lied much too much, and you lied again
Caught you on the couch with my best friend

And if it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this
And if you had not gone and done me wrong
I would not go off like this
Yeah, even I am surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this

Songs like this one
That tells the whole world
Just what a jerk you are

And if it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this
And if you had not gone and done me wrong
I would not go off like this
Yeah, even I am surprised
How easy sweet revenge rolls off my lips
If it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this

No, if it was not for guys like you
There would not be songs like this

What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You want to shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
What you've been up there searching for
Forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you sit around thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count cause you can't get it back

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
What you've been up there searching for
Forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
What you've been up there searching for
Forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh it sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, yeah
What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count, 'cause you can't get it back
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else
Seem so small, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide it swallows you whole
While you're sitting around thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem
So small, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And then you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else seem
So small
Yeah, yeah
---
You better take it from me
That boy is like a disease
You run and you try, and you're tryin' to hide
And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again, 'cause I been where you been
And I know how it ends, you can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe but you won't be deceived
If you listen to me and take my advice
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Run, run away, don't let him mess with your mind
He'll tell you anything you wanna hear
He'll break your heart, it's just a matter of time
But just remember
He's a good-time cowboy Casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise, a snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life
Oh, you better run for your life

I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he would not understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you are standing at a crossroad
There is a choice you got to make

I guess it is going to have to hurt
I guess I am going to have to cry
And let go of some things I have love
To get to the other side
I guess it is going to break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It is sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

I know there is a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet

I guess it is going to have to hurt
I guess I am going to have to cry
And let go of some things I have loved
To get to the other side
I guess it is going to break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It is sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

Time, time heals
The wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now

I guess it is going to have to hurt
I guess I am going to have to cry
And let go of some things I have loved
To get to the other side
I guess it is going to break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It is sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I am going to have to cry
And let go of some things I have loved
To get to the other side
Starts with goodbye
The only way you try to find
Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Na na na na na na na

Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
Because a halfway house will never be a home
At night she whispers to her baby girl
"Someday we will find our place here in this world"

This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers
"Don't cry for me, I will see you all someday"
He looks up and says
"I can see God's face"

This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

This is our temporary home

Yesterday I got a call
Someone I didnt know at all had passed away
Mama said, "Yeah you know him
You went to school with both his kids
They lived out on Prescott lane"
She said, "You shouldve seen the line
Mrs. Johnson said to tell you 'Hi'"

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes you go round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that wont forget you
Cause when youre lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah

Last June my cousin tied the knot
Didnt know if Id go or not
But Im sure glad I did
It was a pretty good haul but worth the drive
I could feel myself come back to life
The closer that Id get
First red light I rolled the windows down
Breathed it in and took a look around

Thank God for hometowns
First kisses and touchdowns
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that wont forget you
And when youre lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns

I always find another piece of me
Walking down these old familiar streets

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes them go round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that wont forget you
And when youre lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Thank God for hometowns

In the circles I have been running
I have covered many miles
And I could search forever for what is right before my eyes
Just when I thought I would find it
It was nothing like I would planned
When I got my heart around it, it slipped right through my hands
Here with you I feel it
I close my eyes and see it

In a midnight talk, in a morning kiss
When I am in your arms, that is where it is
When we are tangled up and cannot resist
When we feel that rush, that is where it is
That is where it is

When I am crashing through the madness
Not sure who I am supposed to be
When I am caught up in the darkness
It is your hand that is leading me
You bring me back to solid ground
You lift me up right here, right now


It is a lifetime filled with tight embraces
The biggest things in the smallest places


In the sweetest smile, on a night like this
And a tender touch, that is where it is
When we are tangled up, and cannot resist
When we feel that rush, that is where it is
That is where it is
The First Noel the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
And by the light of that same star
Three Wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
This star drew nigh to the northwest
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
And there it did both Pause and stay
Right o'er the place where Jesus lay
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind hath bought
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel!
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel!

Front row center in that little white church
I was singing at a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see

I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And mama said you cried all the way home

You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm in my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love

Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am, yeah ooh
Ooh, yeah

All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me

Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm at my weakest
You believe in me
Yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am

This boy here wants to move too fast
He sees my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

That boy there, well he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
We'll I don't think so
I don't think so

Cheap date, bad taste, another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not trying
Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And, I , I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games, Raider Nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not trying
Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And, I , I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me
The warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not trying
Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog
And, I , I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet the more I love my dog

The more I love my dog

Sitting up on the roof
Sneaking a smoke by the chimney
Checking out the moon
And the city lights
He takes off his flannel shirt
And he drapes it around her shoulders
Slides up behind her and holds on tight
And she says
"I don't want this night to end
Why does it have to end?"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Ooh
A tear falls off her cheek and
Right when it hits his arm, he says
"Come on baby, let's get out of here"
They take one last drive around town
And man, it already looks different
He bangs the wheel and says "Life ain't fair"
And this growing up stuff man, I don't
I just don't want to let you go"

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge, LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It ain't much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
The night before life goes on

Yeah, that's what my momma told me
And just like those kids
I didn't want to listen to no one
Yea, there's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can say
And I know how it feels when love goes away

Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10
Baton Rouge LSU
18 years in her rear view
He's got a Friday paycheck lined up down the block
At daddy's shop
It is not much, but it's a job
They've been dreading this moment all summer long
But here it is, they don't have long
The night before life goes on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

There's a place out there for us
More than just a prayer or anything you've ever dreamed of
So when you feel like giving up
Cause you don't fit in down here
Fear is crashing in, close your eyes and take my hand yeah

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us, there's a place for us

When the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life
When these broken hands are whole again
We'll find what we've been waiting for
We were made for so much more

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us, there's a place for us
So hold on, hold on
There's a place for us

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us
The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips
And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

Maybe it is the way that the stars are aligned
That is making me feel this way tonight
Maybe it is the words you left unsaid
Maybe it is the stardust in my hand

But I want to tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't time like this time baby

Maybe it is the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Is making all the pieces fit
Making it all make perfect sense

But I want to tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, yeah
I can't wait another minute
Life is short, love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time baby
Goes by so fast
Can't get it back
Ain't no time like this time

Yeah, I just want to tell you
That my heart is busting at the seams, Yeah, and
I can't wait another minute
Oh, life is short
Love is sweet
Ain't no time like this time, baby
My little baby
Maybe it's the way that the stars are aligned
And there ain't no time
Ain't no time
Ain't no time like this time baby

Maybe it is the way that the night is still
Or the sound of the rain on my windowsill
Yeah, yeah

Baby you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I'd never need you, baby

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong

Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
If they don't feel you loving me
They all say that I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late now to save me
I'm too tangled

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Maybe it's not right
But that's all right
Yeah, it's all right tonight

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Even if it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little twisted
Yeah
It's twisted
Yeah

Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife

Last night, I was pouring out my heart
Like a waterfall to you
And with one kiss, I was a runaway train
Flying off the track to you
"I love you" came flooding out
Could not make it stop, couldn't shut my mouth
I felt like a fool when I lied and said I was sorry
But

I un-apologize, I meant every word
Would not take back the way I feel about you
I cannot unsay what you heard, because you heard me right
And I would not try to fight them back
Or hide my feelings for you
I un-apologize

You know, people say a lot of things
That they do not really mean
And last night, I told a little white lie
Hoping you would forget the scene
Where it felt like a movie under the porch light
Could not help myself when you held me tight
Said what I meant, then I lied and said I was sorry


Oh there is no time to be
Holding it all and trying to pretend
That I do not feel anything
Oh, I should not have said I am sorry


Because you heard me right, yeah
I un-apologize

I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw them in the trash
And I'm not even sad

Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely, and took me for a ride
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Standing at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just cannot get it back
Let us face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out and I am getting to take it

I do not want to spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I had let all these years go by
Wasted

Another glass of whisky but it still does not kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He says it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Got to face it

Because I do not want to spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I had let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh I do not want to keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I will not spend any more time
Wasted

She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floating side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while

Hey, yeah
Oh, I do not want to spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I had let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh I do not want to keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I will not spend any more time
Wasted

Oh, I do not want to spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I had let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh I do not want to keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I will not spend any more time
Wasted
I was sitting on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standing at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leaving things behind
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Time, time heals
The wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved
To get to the other side
Starts with goodbye
The only way you try to find
It's sad but, Moving on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
Na na na na na na na

While we are young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I am special
Cover me with sweetness
Because a time will come
When we are not so young, and beautiful
While we are young and beautiful
Living free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancing in our bare feet
Because when the summer is done
We might not be so young, and beautiful

It is a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we are young and beautiful

While we are young and beautiful
We will party down on Main street
Wearing next to nothing
Feeling every heart beat
Having fun, while we are still young and beautiful


Beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful

It is a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we are young and beautiful
Oh, so beautiful

While we are young and beautiful
Cover me with sweetness
While we are young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you do
Oh, yeah
Oh so beautiful

Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your tail lights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame

And I am not sorry that it is over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away

And you should know, please believe me
I have picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it is been so long, it is never easy
It is like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?

How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It is no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry

I am not sorry that it is over
But for the way we let it end
I could not find the words to say

And you should know, please believe me
I have picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it is been so long, it is never easy
It is like trying to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? What can I say?
What can I say? What can I say?

I hate to think all you had of me

Is a memory I left you
The space between what was meant to be

And the mess that it turned into


It is like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?
What can I say?
What can I say?
What child is this who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet
While shepherds watch our keeping?
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him, Lord
The Babe, the Son of Mary
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant King to own Him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the Son on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary
This, this is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him, Lord
The Babe, the Son of Mary




Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah


Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sitting in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise

And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love

Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah



I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies

Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door

It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around

God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it will take us next
Babies are born and at the same time, someone's taking their last breath

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around

In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down
It's the wheel of the world

I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on moving anyway

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around
And around
It's the wheel of the world turning around

It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world turning around
And around

When you look back on times we had
I hope you smile
And know that through the good and through the bad
I was on your side when nobody could hold us down
We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
And, no they would not forget

Whenever you remember times gone by
Remember how we held our heads so high
When all this world was there for us
And we believed that we could touch the sky
Whenever you remember, I will be there
Remember how we reached that dream together
Whenever you remember

When you think back on all we have done
I hope you are proud
When you look back and see how far we have come
It was our time to shine
And nobody could hold us down
They thought they would see us fall
But we, we stood so tall
And, no we would not forget

Oh, yeah

We claimed the brightest star
And we, we came so far
You know that we, we showed them all
And, no they would not forget
Yeah


Whenever you remember
Oh, whenever you remember

Who are you
The one for whom Id really gladly suffer
Who are you
The one Id always love above another
Youre my world, youre my hope, youre all my dreams and all my heart

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do

Who are you
Who takes me through the flood and through the fire
Who are you
Who leads me through the desert and the dry
Youre in my thoughts, you know my mind
You are my fate, you are my light

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do

Youre my savior, youre my center
My beginning and my end
The one I live for, youre my angel
Who are you
Youre in my thoughts 
You know my mind 
You are my fate, you are my light

Who are you
The one I'd give my life to
Who are you
That loves as deep as I do
Who are you
Who fell on me like fire
Who are you
Who takes me through desire
Who are you
You're the one I'd give my life to

Once upon a time our world was on fire and I loved to watch it burn
Wild and reckless, never any limits, guess I had a lot to learn
Cause fire turns to embers, embers to ashes that blow away too soon

Now everything after you is like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you dont even miss me
Once youve tasted a love that strong you cant go back
And you cant settle on anything less
And thats what gets me. Its like having wine after whiskey

Looking back I guess it's really for the best, still youre something that I crave
Even though I know it was right to let you go. Youre a habit hard to break
I got used to being high and nothing that I try seems good enough right now

Its all so watered down like having wine after whiskey
It went from do anything for you babe to you dont even miss me
Once youve tasted a love that strong
You cant go back and you cant settle on anything less
And thats what gets me. Its like having wine after whiskey

Once youve tasted a love that strong you cant go back
And you cant settle on anything less
And thats what gets me
It's like having wine
Its like having wine after whiskey
Well, I like my lovin' done country style
And this little girl would walk a country mile
To find her a good old slow talkin' country boy
I said a country boy
I'm about as old fashioned as I can be
And I hope you're likin' what you see
'Cause if you're lookin' at me
You're lookin' at country
You don't see no city when you look at me
'Cause a country's all I am
I love a' runnin' barefooted through the old cornfields
And I love that country ham
Well, you say I'm a' made just to fit your plans
But does a barnyard shovel fit your hand?
If your eyes are on me
You're lookin' at country
Well, this here country is a little green
And there's a lot of country that a' you ain't seen
I'll show you around if you'll show me a weddin' band
I said a weddin' band
When it comes to love, well I know about that
Country folks all know where it's at
If you're lookin' at me
You're lookin' at country
No, you don't see no city when you look at me
'Cause a country's all I am
I love a' runnin' barefooted through the old cornfields
And I love that country ham
Well, you say I'm a' made just to fit your plans
But does a barnyard shovel fit your hands?
If your eyes are on me, you're lookin' at country
Yeah, if your eyes are on me, you're lookin' at country

Did you check the tires
Put gas in the car
Don't think you need too much, cause you ain't gonna get that far
Did you pack the good times
Don't forget a map
Just in case the route you take isn't there to take you back

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But, you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this
No, you won't find this

There's once in a lifetime
And there's once in a while
And the difference between the two is about a million miles
Oh, you might get lucky while the moon is looking up
But in the truth of the morning, the stars will be long gone

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But, you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
But you won't find this

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But, you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end close is all there is
Oh, in the end it's me you're going to miss
Cause you won't find this
Oh, you won't find this

We wasn't rich, we wasn't poor
Lived on a cul-de-sac 'til my parents divorced
I drove a hand-me-down Ford pickup truck
We had to drive ten miles just to sink it in the mud
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

I went to private school for a couple of years
And I loved Jesus, but I still drank beer
I played high school football, but I didn't start
Coach said I was slow but I hit real hard

Hey, hey what can I say
I grew up in the heartland USA
I sing it loud and proud and I make a lotta noise
I'm an all-American middle class white boy
Hey, hey

Lived in the sticks 'til I moved to the city
But the stars ain't as bright and the girls ain't as pretty
I still say "yes sir, ma'am and y'all"
So don't you be hatin' on the way I talk Hoss

Hey, hey what can I say
I grew up in the heartland USA
I sing it loud and proud and I make a lotta noise
I'm an all-American middle class white boy
Hey, hey

I like what I like, I am who I am
And even when they lose, I'm still a Bulldog fan
I rocked DMX when I was I kid
And now I sing country music like my daddy did

Hey, hey what can I say
I grew up in the heartland USA
I sing it loud and proud and I make a lotta noise
I'm an all-American
Hey, hey what can I say
I grew up in the heartland USA
I sing it loud and proud and I make a lotta noise
I'm an all-American middle class white boy
Hey
Middle class white boy
Hey

Ridin' down red dirt
Drivin' in a white truck
Lookin' at a pretty blue sky
Tired eyed kids playin' in a sprinkler
Daddy drinkin' cold bud light
Talk about a big life
In a small town, ain't got a lot
But we sure found what we were looking for
Georgia red lipstick, tied white tanktop
Levi denim blue eyes
Bottle rockets blowin' up
Hot dogs servin' up
It ain't even fourth of july
That's just how it is 'round here and we love it
We wouldn't trade it all in for nothin' more

Ohhh
It's in the song, baby can't you feel it?
Ohhh
And if you can't baby, listen to the lyrics
It's Friday night freedom
Football game
It's proud of where you from
Its your last name
It's thirteen stripes and fifty stars in the wind
So hold up your beer and holler if you hear it
That American spirit

Old red six string, white piece of paper
Scribbled down, lovin' blue ink
Sweet pretty girl, sweet southern melody
Sweep her right off of her feet
It's a preacher, it's an aisle
It's a ring on a finger and bible
And a title on a fixer up house

Ohhh
It's in the song, baby can't you feel it?
Ohhh
And if you can't baby, listen to the lyrics
It's Friday night freedom
Football game
It's proud of where you from
Its your last name
It's thirteen stripes and fifty stars in the wind
So hold up your beer and holler if you hear it
That American spirit
Ohhh
It's in the song, baby can't you feel it?
Ohhh
And if you can't baby, listen to the lyrics
It's Friday night freedom
Football game
It's proud of where you from
Its your last name
It's thirteen stripes and fifty stars in the wind
So hold up your beer and holler if you hear it
That American spirit

Ridin' down red dirt
Drivin' in a white truck
Lookin' at a pretty blue sky

This is the beat that puts the fire in your feet
Gives you the license to be a little crazy
This is the groove that gives you swagger to move
And gets you talkin' real smooth to a lady
This is the hook that gets you givin' the look
That gets you gettin' the number in your pocket
This is the part where the bass gonna start
And even last call can't stop it

All night anthem
Ain't never gonna leave your head
All night anthem
Ain't nobody goin' to bed
'Til the drinks go down
And the sun comes up
The rhythm's gonna hold you for ransom
It's an all-night anthem

And this is the verse where you don't know the words
And you don't give a damn cause it feels good
Put a whole generation in heavy rotation
Play it over and over and it's still good
This is the sound of a big little town
Just throwin' it down where the floor is
You startin' to feel the momentum build
So bring it on back to the chorus

All night anthem
Ain't never gonna leave your head
All night anthem
Ain't nobody goin' to bed
'Til the drinks go down
And the sun comes up
The rhythm's gonna hold you for ransom
It's an all-night anthem



This ain't about who's got money
And it ain't about what kind of car you drive
This ain't about where you came from
And it ain't about how you're gettin' home tonight
This ain't' about who's got money
And it ain't about what kind of car you drive
This ain't about where you came from
It's about livin' while you're alive

All night anthem
Ain't never gonna leave your head
All night anthem
Ain't nobody goin' to bed
'Til the drinks go down
And the sun comes up
The rhythm's gonna hold you for ransom
It's an all-night anthem

It's an all-night anthem, yeah, yeah
It's an all-night anthem, baby
All-night anthem
All-night anthem

Well it's shoulder to shoulder up in here tonight
Got bottles poppin', floor is rockin', packed in tight
It's hot, and it's hazy
And it's loud, and it's crazy
Girl, when you take my hand
You don't even understand

Everything that's going on is just background music
And everything except you girl just fades away
It's like me and you, are the only two
Dancin' 'round this crowded room
So, tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything
Into background music 


Girl it don't really matter where we are
Your face outshines the moon, the sun, and stars 
Baby, your eyes are like diamonds
And your smile's so blindin'
I could be front row at the Stones
And I wouldn't even know they're on

Everything that's going on is just background music
And everything except you girl just fades away
It's like me and you, are the only two
Dancin' 'round this crowded room
So, tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music

Oh baby girl, you know you got all my attention
Ain't even gotta say a word cause baby I miss it
Everything that's goin' on is just background music 
Everything except you girl just fades away 
It's like me and you are the only two
Dancin' 'round this crowded room, so

Everything that's going on is just background music
And everything except you girl just fades away
It's like me and you, are the only two
Dancin' 'round this crowded room
So, tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it 
Turning everything into background music
Tell me how you do it
Turning everything into background music

If I could have a beer with Jesus
Heaven knows Id sip it nice and slow
Id try to pick a place that aint too crowded
Or gladly go wherever he wants to go
You can bet Id order up a couple tall ones
And tell the waitress put em on my tab
Id be sure to let him do the talkin
Careful when I got the chance to ask

Tell me, howd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Do you hear the prayers I send?
What happens when life ends?
And when you think youre comin back again?
Id tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

If I could have a beer with Jesus
Yeah, Id put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
And I'd fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
Sit somewhere we couldnt see a clock

And ask him, howd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Have you been there from the start?
Howd you change a sinners heart?
And is heaven really just beyond the stars?
Yeah, Id tell everyone, but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus

He can probably only stay, for just a couple rounds
But I hope and pray hes stayin till we shut the whole place down

Ask him, howd you turn the other cheek
To save a sorry soul like me?
Whats on the other side?
Is Mom and Daddy alright?
And if it aint no trouble, tell them I said hi
Id tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
Id tell everyone but no one would believe it
If I could have a beer with Jesus
When you're sick of the same old songs
From the same old band on the bar marquee, call me up
If you're climbin' the walls, baby we could hang, hang, hang
If you're ridin' around this re-run town
And you need a little company baby, call me up
Hit me up, tell ya what, it ain't no thang thang thang

When you're startin' at the same ol ceiling
And you're watching the fan go 'round and round call me up

When that bottle of wine ain't doin' the trick, baby get your fix

We carved our initials that old live oak tree
Your hand next to my hand in the brand new concrete
Your love changed just like the weather
So cold, girl, I oughta wear a sweater
Who knew that forever could be so temporary?

Sometimes I wish I had a cardboard heart
It wouldn't hurt me when you tore it apart
And movin' on wouldn't be so dang hard
If I only, if I only had a cardboard heart

Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on, yeah
Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on

There ain't no prescription for this breakup drama
No kind of physician that could fix this trauma
Now she's on a plane to Hawaii
First class with a brand new guy
Who knew she could play me like an old ukulele?

Sometimes I wish I had a cardboard heart
It wouldn't hurt me when you tore it apart
And movin' on wouldn't be so dang hard
If I only, if I only had a cardboard heart

Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on, yeah
Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on

Oughta head down to the UPS
Grab a box, cut it out, stick it on my chest
I know it ain't real, but it feels no pain
Now sing along with me if you feel the same

Sometimes I wish I had a cardboard heart
It wouldn't hurt me when you tore it apart
And movin' on wouldn't be so dang hard
If I only, if I only had a cardboard heart

Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on, yeah
Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on
Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on, yeah
Fold it up, I could just fold it up and move on

Anybody wanna pop a top on a random Tuesday night?
Anybody wanna build a fire in a circle of truck headlights?
Anybody wanna hit the field and get into some trouble?
Or go way, way, way back in the woods with a big ol' capital W?

You got my number, hit me up if you're tryin' to fill your cup
All you ladies in Luccheses with that denim all riped up, I'm singin'

Ain't no gate code, just hop that fence
Ain't no dress code, baby, come on in
Just pour your worries on Sonic ice, yeah
And we gon' get you feelin' alright
Got that country gold comin' out of your radio
A little more funk at the end of your gravel road
Ain't tryin' to brag, but we got it all figured out
That's how we do it in the dirty south
Break it down like, like, like

The smaller the town, the bigger the party 
We out in the sticks and gettin' it started
So grab all your friends and tell everybody
The smaller the town, the biggger the party 

I will not take a pill in Ibiza, but I will do a shot of tequila
I'll break out my guitar under the stars
And sing you some Oh My Maria
Yeah, we got a handle of Tito's just me and all my amigos
Gonna hit a little bump, bump, bumpy road
On the way to the spot only we know

Ain't no gate code, just hop that fence
Ain't no dress code, baby, come on in
Just pour your worries on Sonic ice, yeah
And we gon' get you feelin' alright
Got that country gold comin' out of your radio
A little more funk at the end of your gravel road
Ain't tryin' to brag, but we got it all figured out
That's how we do it in the dirty south
Break it down like, like, like

Got that country gold comin' out of your radio
A little more funk at the end of your gravel road
Ain't tryin' to brag, but we got it all figured out
That's how we do it in the dirty south
Break it down like, like, like

Ah, that country gold, ah
Country gold

So I guess it's over baby
Dj vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
I guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one
That's in the shoes that I am

Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me
Right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck
If others don't sing sad songs

Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn
That's right
Another lover crash and burn

Do you hear that?
I'm right back
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that?
It's where I'm at
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

I never had something that I can't walk away from
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's something 'bout you girl I just can't fight

You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

All the in-between is killing me
You know I come unglued from missing you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do

I never had something that I can't walk away from 
But, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience 
There's something 'bout you I just can't fight

You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you
Craving you

I'm always craving you
Craving you
Craving you

Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm counting down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go


You're like that cigarette
That shot of 100 proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving
That feeling when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always craving you, yeah
Craving you

Craving you
I'm craving you baby
I'm craving you
I'm craving you babe

Baby last night was hands down
One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man
A happy man baby

And baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
Youre a saint, youre a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in the wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, yeah

I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace

Oh if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man

Baby I could die a happy man
Oh I could die a happy man
You know I could die
I could die, I could die a happy man

Drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a Tennessee girl, a Rocky Top breeze
And a big ol' yellow moon
A new set of strings on my '69
And a Yeti full of iced-down booze
Everybody 'round this sleepy little town
Heading down Pinetucky Road
Gonna leave our worries in a cloud of dust
Right there by the old fence post

Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Got a pig in the ground, stars in the sky
And a jar full of lightning juice
Got a worn-out path to the river bank
Everybody coming out of them boots
Gonna pick a few songs all night long
Ones that we grew up on
Some fishing in the dark, some Copperhead Road
Everybody just sing along

Gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight
A bunch of down home boys and some blue jean girls
Kicking up the dirt and shooting out the lights
Life can be an ol' briar patch
Gotta dance your way through it sometimes
So we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music
And have a big time tonight

Yeah, we're gonna drink a little beer, play a little music

That's right

Ah, come on boys, whoo
This is so weird having my dad on a song right now
Considering he's 50
Uh, 47
I think he's gonna make a comeback album and this is the start of it
I taught you everything you know, son
But not everything I know
We through playing now
We ain't kickin' it inside
We ain't kickin' it outside
We're just sippin' moonshine watchin' chicken fry
And makin' that swing swing side to side
Singin' "Hoop, hoop, hoopty do"
Come on, girl, can you feel that groove?
The mandolin is strummin'
All my friends are comin'
We're just chillin', grillin', willin' to get funky
Yeah, we're just some front porch junkies


We ain't kickin' it uptown 
We ain't kickin' it downtown 
We're just lightin' it up on the low-down
Blowin' smoke on a Blue Tick Coonhound
Singin' "Boom, boom, boom-di-boom!"
Come on, y'all, can you feel that groove?
Swamp air comin' through the screen door
Bare feet stompin' on the wood floor
We're just diggin' it, finger lickin' pickin' out in the country
Yeah, we're just some front porch junkies


Just sittin' here workin' on a flip-flop tan
Got a cold Bush light and a coozie in my hand
Dang, I don't be needin' no white sand beach
I got the sweetest little Georgia peach in a two piece
Belly button ring is shinin' like a diamond
Says I oughta be up onstage at the Ryman
I don't need no crowd, no light, smoke production
The beer's ice cold and the subwoofer's bumpin'
Sittin' on a cloud, feelin' pretty lucky
Dang, it feels good to be a front porch junkie


We ain't kickin' it inside 
We ain't kickin' it outside 
We're just sippin' moonshine watchin' chicken fry
And makin' that swing swing side to side
Singin' "Hoop, hoop, hoopty do"

Does your heart skip a beat when he kisses you, baby?
Yeah, I just gotta know for my peace of mind
Staying up all night 'cause it's driving me crazy
Tell me yes or no, either way, I'm fine

Last time we talked, said you'd never been better
That's what you said, though, when we were together
Mine in July, but you're his in December

I guess I was your gateway love
I didn't get you high enough
Kinda like an 8th grade crush that never lasts
Are you on that heavy stuff?
Tell me, did you find the one, find the one I thought I was?
But now I know that I was just your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby

Was I just one piece of the puzzle you played?
Did you have your eye on a different prize?
Was it just another number on a whole other waitlist?
I knew it had to end, but it was sublime

Last time we talked, said you'd never been better
That's what you said, though, when we were together
Mine in July, but you're his in December

Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Yeah, I was your gateway love, baby
Nothing but your gateway love, baby

Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move
But I just can't wait no more
Can't let you slip out that door
You're the prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah gotta get me some of that

Little more what you doin' right there
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy now girl I swear
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song

You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah gotta get me some of that

In my ride, by my side, down the highway
In the dark, in my arms, in your driveway
All because of that smile you threw my way
Yeah girl you got a way of

You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights

You're my forever, my slice of heaven
On this side of the Mississippi River, baby
You're my infinity, no end to you and me
Come hell, fire, or rain, baby, nothin' can change it
No, nothin' can change it

Ooh, when the good Lord calls me home and this life is through
I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die
Can't take diamonds, can't take gold
But I'll take your love with me when I go
I'm gonna take it to the grave with me

You're my destiny, you'll always be with me
Today, tomorrow, all the way to eternity, baby
No last breathe taken on this earth
No concrete tombstone, no amount of dirt can change it
No, nothin' can change it

I may be six feet deep, but I'll still be lovin' you
Baby, what we got won't ever die

Busy working hard, wrapped up in my job, we got bills to pay
Lately, when we talk, it feels like I don't hear a single word you say
Can we get back to the basics
And find that young love and make it?
And tear down all these walls
Ignore all of our calls and just stay in

Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

Lightning on my skin
Every touch remembering what you mean to me, oh
Let me reminisce my lips on your lips
Like a symphony, you're playing on my heartstrings

Kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

It's been a little crazy lately
Come on and remind me, baby
Well, girl, don't keep me waiting
Come on over my way and lay it on me

And kiss me like a stranger
Baby, hold me like we've never met
Every touch, a little danger
Like you ain't gotten used to me yet
Strike a match, light the fuse
You and I, we could use some reckless behavior
So, baby, kiss me like a stranger

Ooh, won't you kiss me, won't you kiss me
Won't you kiss me like a stranger
Mmm, yeah, won't you kiss me like a stranger
Ooh, I got plans for you, I got plans for you

Kiss me like a stranger
You feeling now, ooh
You feeling now, ooh
You feeling now, ooh

How to be proud of that town ain't nobody heard of
Had a big dream, seventeen, some day how to grow up
How to make dust fly out on a no name road
Yeah, I learned it from the radio

How to wake up, how to work tough
How to roll up those sleeves, how to throw down
How to get loud, and what to put in that drink
To give the stars in the sky a little halo
Yeah, I learned it from the radio

If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
How to let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

What to say when you think that you've found that girl
Who to call when she's gone and she wrecks your world
How to get over it, yeah how to let her go
I learned it from the radio

How to see it all, from a front porch
And how to say it all just using three chords
And when to run when you're young
When to come back home
I learned it from the radio

If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I hadn't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
How to let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we use to burn it up, turn it up, up, up

If it wasn't for the speakers in the door
Telling me a truth I haven't ever heard before
I never woulda kissed that girl
Never woulda known what to say
I would have never known better
How to let her get away
Thank God for four wheel drive
Thank God for windows down
And all the DJ's in all those little static towns
How to live, how to love
Everything I need to know
I learned it from the radio

From the radio
I learned it from the radio
Back when we use to burn it up, turn it up

Same streets, same party
Drowning their problems in Bacardi
Same people still talking
Whoa, I'm so over it, I'm sorry

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could

If not, I get it
That smile on your face, yeah, it says different
One kiss, girl, just try it
'Cause you never know, you just might like it

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

You and me could
You and me could
We can leave right now
You and me could
If you like how that sounds
You and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could
Oh, baby, you and me could

Same streets, same party
Same people still talking

Baby, you and me can leave right now
Ditch all your friends, and the guy you came with
Get to know you where it ain't so loud
Just you and me alone, some old moonlit road
Well, the two of us could disappear
Just say the word, we'll get outta here
Baby, you and me can leave right now
Meet me out back if you like how that sounds

Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I bought a ring and she said, "I do"
But everybody else said, "Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?"
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die happy, man

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen"
Well I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no

Throw on your boots and your jeans
With the worn out seams
And your goin' out shirt
Put some shine on your truck
Get it all cleaned up just to kick it in the dirt
You point them high beam lights into drive, start comin' alive
You point them high beam lights into Friday night
And you swear this life never burns as bright
As it does now

So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

Build you a fire, sing along
To a feel good song
At the top of your lungs
Grab a jar, twist the top
Hold your breath, take a shot
Feel the fire on your tongue
And let it drown your pride and your butterflies
Tell the girl you like what you're feelin' tonight
And pull her in tight, let the sparks ignite
Like the fourth of July

So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

You'll be together like this
Like it's the last time
You're ever gonna taste that kiss

So soak it all up, let it sink in
Crank it up loud, all the way to ten
Raise your cup to the sky
Tip 'em back to friends and let your party lights shine
On top of the world, in the back of a truck
Livin' like the sun ain't comin' back up
Yeah, buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Like it's the last time

Yeah buddy tonight
We're gonna do it up right
Gonna do it up right
Whoa like it's the last time
Yeah like it's the last time

Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio
Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

Now baby don't you look at me that way
Cause you know there's only so much I can take
Cause you make me want to

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You know better than to wear that dress
It oughta be against the law
Plain and simple, girl, them dimples
Know just how to turn me on

Now baby don't you look at me that way
Cause you know there's only so much I can take
Cause you make me wanna

Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop I'm gonna
Girl you make me wanna

You make me wanna
Wake up with you, in the bed of my truck
And start over again when the sun comes up

You make me wanna
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinking
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol

Windows down, country sound, FM on the radio

She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no

I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire

Ooo-ooo
I could find a spot to
Go hang out on Friday night
Where you are gonna be
But I don't want to, no
Yeah, I could let it end
Call it quits, call off
All this on and off again
But I just don't want to

Yeah that key
Is right under the mat
Come on in, baby
Let's strike that match

I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher
But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby
I'm all tangled up in barbed wire
I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy
But guess I like playing with fire
Playing with fire

So let's fire it up one more time

Baby just put your lips on mine


I don't know, why I don't
Put it out baby
We kiss and the flames
Just get higher

But yeah I know
When I hold onto you baby

I'm all tangled up in barbed wire


I get burned, I don't learn
I'll be back, give it time

Yeah, I know it sounds crazy

But guess I like playing with fire

Playing with fire


Playing with fire, huh

I know I should let it go
Take a different road
When I'm driving home
But I don't want to
Delete your number from my phone
Instead of calling
Asking if you're all alone
But I don't want to

Stay away
From your side of town
But it's too late
I'm in your drive right now

I don't know, why I don't

Poor boy, rich girl, what a clich
One car, two hearts, wanna run away
'Cause they know it was meant to be
His little bullet in the shotgun seat
Poor boy, rich girl, bit like you and me
So come on

Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

Little renegade love out there on the run
Yeah, two innocent souls were the smoking gun
Yeah, they were living the American dream
His little beauty in some cut-off jeans, yeah
Small town clich, bit like you and me
So come on

Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

Well, they can tell you what to think, yeah
But they can't tell you who to love
So, baby, come along with me, leave it in the dust
Ay yeah, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
So come on

Hey, yeah, I promise you your daddy gon' be alright
Oh, baby, you were such a good girl all your life
So what we cause a little trouble?
So what we don't sleep tonight?
Baby, I promise you your daddy's gonna be alright
Gonna be alright

He's gonna be alright, oh, baby
You've been a good girl all your life
He's gonna be alright

Single girl
I know you're out there on a run
Out on a town baby havin' fun
But don't you want someone
Single girl
How long you wanna be all alone
Don't it get lonely baby on your own
Like a rolling stone, well I

I think that I could be the guy
Just what you're missin' baby in your life
By your side
When the nights get cold
And I could be there for you to hold
Oh baby ain't it gettin' old?
Livin' in this lonely world
When you don't have to be single girl

Single girl
Aw you so pretty baby don't you know
You can have anybody that you want
So what you waitin' on
Tell me girl
That smile on your face is it for me
Cause somethin' tells me that you're startin' to see
How it could be
When I

I think that I could be the guy
Just what you're missin' baby in your life
By your side
When the nights get cold
And I could be there for you to hold
Oh baby ain't it gettin' old?
Livin' in this lonely world
When you don't have to be single girl

Oh single girl
Don't wanna rush you girl
But I promise you can trust me girl
When I tell you, when I tell you
That I

I think that I could be the guy
Just what you're missin' baby in your life
By your side
When the nights get cold
And I could be there for you to hold
Oh baby ain't it gettin' old?
Livin' in this lonely world
When you don't have to be single girl

Oh no, you don't have to be single girl

"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"

What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen

Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah

I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be
When all we cared about was turning sixteen

We don't ever go where the rich kids go, yeah
We do our own thing
We don't cut our hair 'cause we just don't care
Smoke just about anything

Steal a kiss, act a fool, hop a fence, find a pool
Flying free, like a drink, we're

Smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Go on and groove like a mother with your backseat lover
Tear the clothes off each other all night
And keeping it smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh

We don't really care if our hands ain't stamped
Yeah, we always find a way in
The streets are so alive, yeah, we're running all the lights
When they're flashing in the AM

Getting wild, wearing shades, living like we're renegades
No matter what, we're gonna stay

Smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Go on and groove like a mother with your backseat lover
Tearing clothes off each other all night
And keeping it smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh

Smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Go on and groove like a mother with your backseat lover
Tearing clothes off each other all night
And keeping it smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Go on and groove like a mother with your backseat lover
Tear the clothes off each other all night
And keeping it smooth like the summer
Smooth like the summer, uh huh
Well I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands
I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I can play you a song
On this old guitar, if it turns you on
If you want, we could dance
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
Top off, in my jeep
And we can go for a ride and I could drive with my knees
I'll behave, best I can
But I need something to do with my hands
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
Yeah maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair
And we can get to rockin'
There you are and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I need something to do with my hands
With my hands
Something to do with my hands
Dear bosses and strangers, gossips and cops
Ex-girlfriends and neighbors whose names I won't drop
To anyone who disapproves of anything we're about to do
I'm sorry for partying and Bacardi'n
What's happenin' in the back yard again
It started with a couple friends and some dude in a cardigan
Came rollin' in at 3 am
I don't know when it's gonna end
So for now, I'm sorry for... woah
Partying, partying... woah
Partying, partying
Dear judges and lawyers, to the kid that cuts my grass
To the Mardi Gras martyrs stayin' up late at night pickin' up trash
For anyone gettin' caught by a camera phone with your pants off
I'm sorry for partying and Bacardi'n
What's happenin' in the back yard again
It started with a couple friends and some dude in a cardigan
Came rollin' in at 3 am
I don't know when it's gonna end
So for now, I'm sorry for... woah
Partying, partying... woah
Partying, partying
Dear Grandma in Georgia who ain't even up
Yeah that picture wasn't for you
Yeah, that's just my luck
I'm sorry for partying and Bacardi'n
What's happenin' in the back yard again
It started with a couple friends and some dude in a cardigan
Came rollin' in at 3 am
I don't know when it's gonna end
So for now, I'm sorry for... woah
Partying, partying... woah
Partying, partying
Woah... partying, partying
Woah... partying, partying

Please commence shaking your south side
Thomas on that beat

Every single girl, shake your south side
All around the world, shake your south side 

Oh, yeah

Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you

Woke up this morning to your sleepy smile
I realized I haven't told you in a while
That you're my life, you're my dream
You're the reason for every song I sing
You're my rock, you're my world
You're my always and forever, girl

Sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

Yeah, you're sweet like chocolate, hot like Sriracha
Yeah, girl you got me right in your back pocket
You're smooth like whiskey, fine like wine
I love how you're making my blood sugar rise

My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for
And I can't believe you gave your sweet heart to me

When the world gets cold on those sleepless nights
Oh, girl, you should know that you will always be mine

My sweetheart, God could've never made two
Nobody quite like you
Woah, sweetheart, one kiss and I come unglued
You are the reason I fall to pieces
'Cause you're all that I adore
You're the one my heart beats for

Hey there honey, in your cut up jeans

At you movin' your hips with your pretty lips singin' along to a country song
Climb on up here with me
In my truck cause if we
Don't go ridin' around
I'm gonna run my battery down so
If you're ready to roll girl, just let me know girl
I don't know who brought you here and he left you alone
But he ain't worth the time you're spendin'
Textin' him on the phone girl
It's time to move on girl
I got a radio and a shotgun seat
And it's gettin' late
It's time for me to take you home girl
It's alright if you live way out
I got enough gas to take you all over this town yeah
When we pull in the drive, I'll walk you up to the door

Now he ain't payin' no attention
Don't know what he's missin'

And it's getting late
It's time for me to take you home girl
You can be my home girl

And in my head and in my bed again
And wreckin' me in pieces on the floor

You drive me wild for just a while
I think that I'll keep you from walkin' out that door

Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Stop starin' at the rearview
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel has spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there
Stop holdin' on so dang tight, 'bout time you let go
But he's a heart breakin', let you down, son-of-a-gun
But I ain't sayin' nothin' you don't know

The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl yeah
Is the day you start movin' on

That sun's gonna come up
It's gonna feel good
And after all the rain and pain you've seen
I hope you soak it up like you should
Now and then it's gonna stir up
When you hear that old song
But don't let it get to ya baby
It's only three and a half minutes long
Well

The day you stop lookin' back
You're gonna find that the future
Sure beats the hell outta the past
Now he ain't no good
I guess he's good as gone
The day you stop lookin' back, girl yeah
Is the day you start movin' on

Is the day you start movin' on
You ain't checkin' your hair
That wheel is spun and them lights are out
There ain't nothin' for you back there

Get off work and we meet down at our spot
We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "no way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my

T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, my t-shirt
Oh yeah

We were walking up the stairs
With the neighbors saying "keep it down"
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out
You know what I'm saying
You've been saying that we've gotta quit doin' this
So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

T-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my, my t-shirt
In my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
Cause you sure look good in my t-shirt
Oh no, baby no, I can't lie
You look good on my mind

I said hey, hey baby, do you wanna come over
You say, "no way" then you move in closer
Next thing I know you were wearing my t-shirt
Mmm, you look just so dang hot in my t-shirt
I see you spinning around in my t-shirt
Right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot

My t-shirt right there
Your hair messed up like a Guns-N-Roses video
Oh oh so hot
Still got it up in my head
You were moving around in the TV light
I ain't ever seen anything like
Your dress, my floor
The way you wore my,my t-shirt
In my t-shirt, yeah
You look so good in my t-shirt
My t-shirt
Oh you look so good in my t-shirt

It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin
And that Coldplay song that you were singin
And I bet right now youre probably thinkin
That its crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin, we were buzzin
Takin shots like it was nothin
Did the runnin man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didnt think that it was true

That mango-rita you were drinkin
And that Coldplay song that you were singin
And I bet right now youre probably thinkin
That its crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin
And that Coldplay song that you were singin
And I bet right now youre probably thinkin
That its crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like shes sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks but Im spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting cause its always getting hotter

Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation
Hey, lets party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like its Jamaica and Im sippin' on some Red Stripe
But Im in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light

Hey, lets party like we on vacation
Hey, lets party like we on vacation

Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Ice has started melting so Ill take another swallow

Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation
Hey, lets party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation


Party like Im on vacation

Party like Im on vacation

Party like Im on vacation

Im gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know

Hey, lets party like we on vacation
Hey, lets party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, lets party like we on vacation

Sing it to me
Hey, lets party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation

Hey girl whatcha got in that cup
Gimme a little sip and tell me what's up
With your hey baby now come on don't be shy
And wooo heee that sure is good
You got me trippin' and thinkin' we should
Get to talkin' and maybe hang out tonight
Cause I've been sippin' what you been sippin' on
Never tasted something so sweet, never felt something so strong
And my head's buzzin' baby feeling like I'm falling in love
Hey girl whatcha got in that cup
Now hey girl whatcha got in that cup
Did it come from the hills in the back of a truck
Whatever it is, it's sure messin' me up tonight
Now hey baby do you like this song
Do you wanna go get a slow dance on
Me and you just wrappin' each other tight
Cause I've been sippin' what you been sippin' on
Never tasted something so sweet, never felt something so strong
And my head's buzzin' baby feeling like I'm falling in love
Hey girl whatcha got in that cup
Hey girl whatcha got in that cup
A hundred proof, cause it's kickin' my butt
Can't be jose, can't be jack
Cause I had em before and never felt like that
Hey baby whatcha got in here
Can't be no jager, can't be no beer 
Can't be no kinda mad dog wine
Must be love potion number 9
I've been sippin' what you been sippin' on
Never tasted something so sweet, never felt something so strong
And my head's buzzin' baby feeling like I'm falling in love
Hey girl whatcha got in that cup
Yeah, whatcha got in that cup
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oooooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
I should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
And take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
And now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up this mess I made, no
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oooooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
I should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
And take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
And now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I was probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Gives you all his hours
When he has the chance
Takes you to every party
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

Will you still roll your eyes when I tell dirty jokes?
Will I still hold your hand when we're drivin' down the road?
Will you still hide a bottle of wine in your purse when we're at the movie?
Will you still slap my hand away when I try and smack your booty?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

Will you still rub my feet when I put down the seat?
Will you still call me honey if we run out of money tomorrow?
Will we still walk the dogs, will I still take you fishin'
And dance in the kitchen and listen and sway to Sinatra?
Fly Me To The Moon, baby
When we watch The Notebook, will we still get sentimental?
Will I drop you off at the beauty shop in a Lincoln Continental, singin'

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

When we're 80
Won't you grow young with me, girl?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell me it'll always be this way
You'll be even more beautiful when you're gray and crazy
We'll still kiss and we might cuss
Just tell me that we'll still be us when we're 80
When we're 80

You said you only had time for one drink
But that dress that you're wearing says a whole 'nother thing
You laugh and you smile and you wink
Got my head spinning 'round like a roller rink
It's going places we've never been
And it's getting better with every tonic and gin
Got a Hollywood glow on your skin
Wearin' that "I will if you will" grin

How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

How am I supposed to play it cool
With that sexy, adorable way you move?
I love watching you break your own rules
Come on, let me help you break a few

How are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
Make out on the dance floor
Take it too far out the back door
Leave an open tab, when you look like that?
And tell me how am I supposed to keep my hands to myself
When you're making my mind wander somewhere else?
It's on a one-way track when you look like that

Like a couple million bucks, a bombshell deluxe
Girl, you got it all together, why you messing me up?
I'm seeing you and me as the honkey tonk dream
Saying, "Girl, we're on a roll"

And how are we not supposed to take another lap around the block
And make a pit stop, your place, my place, any place?
Wanna make it last when you look like
When you look like that, yeah

When you look like that, baby
When you look, when you look like that, whoa
You just do something to my soul, I just can't describe it
When you look like that, hoo
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
You drive me crazy when you, when you look like
Just like that right there
I know you love a little late night
Just me and you glowing with the brake light
Silhouettes sipping with a halo
Anything you want, girl, just say so
A little whisper off your lips, yeah
Said you're ready for the moonlight mix, yeah
I keep you spinning 'til you get your fix
'Til the sky gets lit, 'til the sunlight hits, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down 
I just gotta tell you now 
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
And do you thing, baby, cause it's so hot
There it is, yeah, that's the sweet spot
Blow your smoke, I'm gonna breathe it in, girl
Maybe it's a sin but, baby, bring it back again, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down 
I just gotta tell you now 
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
A little whisper off your lips, yeah
Said you're ready for the moonlight mix, yeah
I keep you spinning 'til you get your fix
'Til the sky gets lit, 'til the sunlight hits, yeah
I've been given a piece of heaven
Yeah, you're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Did it hurt when you fell from the sky?
Pretty girl, I'm gonna make you fly
See I was burning but you saved my life
My angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down 
I just gotta tell you now 
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight
Yeah, I'm never gonna let you down 
I just gotta tell you now 
You're my angel, you're my angel tonight

Daddy thinks his brown eyed girl is an angel
She's got a wild side but covers it up so well
She knows how to party, gets a little naughty
Spent a couple nights in jail
And it really turns her on when I let her get behind the wheel

We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And  I'm ready, she's ready feeling like a dream but you know I'm really living
This could be the death of me she's a backwoods beauty queen!

She's gotta look that'll kill and legs that should be a crime
She's a six pack girl you can throw away a bottle of wine
She's got holes in her clothes because anything goes when she's riding in my fourwheel drive
And this small town's dead but she's never felt more alive!

We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And  I'm ready, she's ready feeling like a dream but you know I'm really living
This could be the death of me she's a backwoods beauty queen!

All of the fellas they stay jealous
When I call her mine, oh mine
This girl is one of a kind ain't afraid to have a hell of a time
I ain't saying she ain't gotta good side
But I'm praying I don't see it tonight yeah!!

We go deep down in the woods
Make a little love on the truck hood
And she might be the one to turn a church boy into the devils son
And  I'm ready, she's ready feeling like a dream but you know I'm really living
This could be the death of me woah yeah this girl has got the best of me!
This could be the death of me she's a backwoods beauty queen!
Backwoods beauty queen!

She puts on her work clothes, fishnet panty hose
Shes got a nickname that everyone knows at the Gentlemens club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right
Makes her money one dollar at a time
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name
She wears the pain

Black tears, rolling down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
She reveals, they all cheer, then she crys
Black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes shes convinced
The boss man is still a friend she needs
Shes tried everything, cheap sex and cocaine
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
Wrong kind of famous in her mommas eyes, you can tell she knows it when she cries

Black tears, rolling down from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
White lights on the mirrors, just wont hide
Black tears

She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybodys watching

Black tears, rolling down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinners town
If all the pain could just disappear she'd quit crying, shed quit crying
Black tears
The week was long
But now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music up
Pick up that sweet, somebody wrap your arms around this Friday night
Get a little lost in the party
Flow your trouble like a champagne bubble, saying
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
The night is young
The night is free
And so are we
So let it out
And let me stay inside your drink
Lipstick all along
Next sipping star lie on the window tripping down
Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Two crazy hearts
Looking in the dark for a place to park it to their life
Find an old school way-and-bee
And put a little shine on the bottle seat
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just bumpin' the night
Two bottles of Bud
Two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love
Just bumpin' the night

Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Cloud of dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do when life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for a shooting star and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Hope he's moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, rain and smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Yeah I like a little Captain in my coke
You know I like a little good time in my smoke
With a pair of tan legs hanging off the tailgate
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road

I like fried chicken right off the bone
I like my peaches home grown
Picking on a six string listening to the choir sing
With a little Garth on the radio

A little bit of Florida
A little bit of Georgia
And a whole lot of country in my soul

You see my roots are buried deep down in the south
And these boots don't get muddy from sitting around
Out here in the holler we work hard for a dollar
From sun up to sun down
Well I ain't been handed a thing from the man
And all that I own I got with my own hands
I work hard and play hard so don't be alarmed
That's just who I am

Yeah I like a little Captain in my coke
You know I like a little good time in my smoke
With a pair of tan legs hanging' off the tailgate
Underneath the bridge down Harrison Road



Yeah my way of life is from Jesus to Jones
I've got fire in my blood and desire in my bones
I am who I am and I don't give a damn
Cause that's just how I roll







In my soul In my soul yeah
In my soul Yeah


Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
Shes popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Could not help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let us go get this thing stuck"

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell I cannot get you out of my head

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw yea

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Let's go!

Get your radio up
What up Nelly, alright
I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
Shes poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

I got my windows down and the radio up
Get your radio up

She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, lets go get this thing stuck"

Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

My windows down my seats back
My music up and we ride
Her legs up on my dashboard
And it's just the way I like
Hey country girl, this country boy
Like e'rything about you
Don't change a thing, no way
You stay the same and I got you
I likes all that, all that
Head to toe you all that
Tell ole boy he can call back
Send her a text say, "fall back" cause
I can see you got a thing for the fast life
So come on, shawty, let me show you what the fast like
Whipping 'cross the border, Florida into Georgia
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every hood, every town with you
And this drop-top Chevy painted real slick
It would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Cause baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my, roll my, roll my
R-r-r-r-roll

Baby you're a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Get your radio up
It's not too late
Let me take you on a midnight drive
I might sound crazy baby
Maybe somewhere under the stars
In my car, in the dark
We can park, I don't care what we do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, the way you
Dance for me, dance for me
The way you
Dance for me, dance for me
I'm gonna sit back baby
Sip that Jack and watch you move
It won't be long before
I'm swaying right up next to you
In the lights of the night
Burning bright
From up here on my hood
You look so damn good
When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare
That's it right there, when you
Dance for me, dance for me

When you
Dance for me, dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me
Come on girl, let your hair down
Do a little dance for me

And the right little tune
And you know what to do
I just wanna see you
Dance for me, dance for me
Throw it on the floor for me
Dance for me, dance for me
Yeah come on girl
Get your hands in the air
Shake it down like you just don't care
We can do a little double dare

Yeah, dance for me, dance for me
The way you dance for me, dance for me
Yeah, dance for me, dance for me
The way you dance for me, dance for me

Wait baby, listen you got me twistin' watching you sippin' on that drink
I saw you smile back and I didn't miss that "it's on a little later on" wink
And your song comes on, you dance along
I can't believe how bad you got me like

Dayum, baby dayum, baby dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around, baby 'round, baby 'round
I can see you'll probably be keepin' me up all night 
Yeah, but that's alright 
'Cause girl you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
Yeah you got me like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum

Baby you're rockin', you got me locked in
I know that you're dancing just for me
If you wanna go then, we'll get to rollin'
'Cause I'd love to sweep you off your feet

Like dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum
I love standing here watching you breakin' it down, baby down, baby down
You keep pulling me in when you spinnin' around baby, 'round, baby 'round

Babygirl now you my queen, I got a pocket full of aces

Chasin' your dreams, so real that you can almost taste it
I'm a take you back to the basics, we gon' cover all of the bases
And I'm a lay you down and take my time 'til you can hardly take it
Dayum baby, dayum baby, dayum

Yeah, I grew up ten minutes from the sticks
Ten minutes from the beach
And there ain't a Bible verse, y'all
I ain't heard a preacher preach
Mom and Dad up in the bleachers
Screaming while I pitch

Beating deep on the speakers
Finally riding around the town
With my best friends, ain't life like a whirlwind
One second I'm playing checkers with Grandma
Then my world ends
I used to hear my granddaddy say
Before it's too late

You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

Yeah, I'm a long haired, tattooed, feather in the wind
Yeah,a good ol' boy, just like my old man
Every night when I'm singing
I know he's looking down
Up there next to PawPaw
Got the best seats in the house
When I close my eyes I can still hear him say
The same thing I'm gonna tell my kids

You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

I'm so of proud of where I came from
This town is who I am
And the way I was raised up
Made me a better man
I'm proud of where I cam from
And damn I love this land
And the way that I was raised up
Made me a better man

You gotta dig your roots
'For the sun comes down
Show some love back to your hometown
Fall in love, plant some seeds
Carve some names in the family tree
Raise your kids, love your wife
Put God first, just to live your life
Hey, I think I'm gonna go
And get a little more dirt on my boots
You gotta dig your roots

I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty head light, dance with your boots in it 
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it 
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it 
You know you came from it 
And some day you'll return to

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said "the world comes right to my window every day"... Even if it's broken
 And some day you'll return to)

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, make good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

I don't want to wait until it's friday
Before we hit it sideways
I'm out in your driveway right now
And we ain't gotta wait until it's your birthday
I'm already thirsty, time to shut the workday on down
Yeah I just dropped you off but I'm back to pick you up
No, I can't get enough, need a little more you in my cup
I want to see you move, get my hands on you
My little dj vu, we do this every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Turn around down Indiana main street
When the song is over we put it on repeat, repeat
Topping off another can of crazy
Neighbors probably hate me
They don't get the way we do it every night
We can get to feeling alright right now
Turn it on baby til the sun burns out
You ain't gotta say it girl, I know what you like
We do this every night
Yeah on this trail trail, a little something to sip sip
Don't need no weekend
We do this every night
Hands on your hips and do a little bit of sip sip
A little bit of your sweet kiss
We do this every night
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on 
Baby get your shine on
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here
And get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on 
Baby get your shine on
Homemade jar of lemon drop take a sip
Don't stop girl...
You know I love it when you get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on 
Baby get your shine on
Because you and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky dripping rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on 
Baby get your shine on
Baby get your shine on
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips
Silver buckle hanging off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles
Shinedown on the radio dial
Silverado, candy painted
Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chromed piece tucked in the console
Riding high, roll up on the down low
Baby get your shine on
Well I'm talking 'bout a hometown
A little party back in the pines
I'm really thinkin' 'bout your house
And your couch, and getting some
On a Saturday night
When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah
Well I say a little hey baby 
What's your number and where you from
I'm really thinking about you baby
And the first crazy night I got to get you home
After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me
After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

You know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah
You're the girl on the radio

That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

Every step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow
Every move you make, you know I'll follow you wherever you go
Baby, you know my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally 
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God your mama, and me

She's a little red wine, he's a little bit whiskey smoke
He's a ragged on the edge, she's keeping him holding out hope
She's a front pew hallelujah, drop another 20 in the plate
He's on the back row a little hung over, bout 20 minutes late

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

Well she's sundress cotton, he's grease on a Carhartt shirt
And she's a candle in the wind, he's a light it up and let it burn
And every time she's with him, all she wants to do is kiss him
Starts thinking maybe she can fix him
He's thinkin' he'd love to let her try

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

And every time she's with him
She knows she prolly oughta quit him
But he don't wanna let her get away

She's a good girl, sky blue turquoise
Fallin' for a bad boy, drivin' that Detroit
Big block, cruisin' up the black top
Turnin' up a corn row, scare crow, farm house gravel road
Comin' for a good girl, countin' down the sun set
Never been broke heart, racin' like a Corvette
Got a little wildfire burnin' in her angel eyes
Probably ain't never been lost after midnight
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy
Tryin' to be a good girl, but fallin' for a bad boy

Yeah
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
She's so good, she's so good, she's so good
But fallin' for a bad boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Pretty thing you're making me go back
Looking like a Shania Twain throwback
Picture perfect girl I gotta post that
Sippin' 7 and 7 in your 7 jeans
Put on a string, a little rip on the seam
A southern boys dream, like a movie scene
So go on shake your thing like a leaf
Nobody gonna see it but the moon and me
Come on
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl
I'll get you spinning
You wanna see the world
I'll be your ticket
I'll put your hand in my hand
I'm winning, I'm winning
You like that way that diamond shines
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
You know you got that fire right

Another shot of them blue eyes
Won't need anymore of that moonshine
You're lighting me up my little firefly
I can feel the heat, heat
Blazing to the beat, beat
Backseat GG baby when you do your thing
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl
I'll get you spinning
You wanna see the world
I'll be your ticket
I'll put your hand in my hand
I'm winning, I'm winning
You like that way that diamond shines
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I can feel the heat heat
Blazing to the beat beat
Backseat GG, talking no sleep sleep
Baby when you do your thing
You know you got that fire right
Girl you my good good
Giving me a chance to make your night
You know that I would would
You wanna dance girl

Girl you my good good

What do you say girl
You got that fire that fire
Girl you my good good
You got that fire, that fire

Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out
I know it's kinda scary but it's only temporary doubt
I've done a lot of stupid things
But promise that you're gonna stay long enough
To grow old with me

We're gonna see the good times
Love each other through the bad
It's gonna hurt like hell when we lose our moms and dads
So let my shoulder hold your tears
Walk beside me through the years
Baby, let's see where this love can lead

Let's hold hands on your favorite beach
Fix up a house that we found in the city limits
Tangled up in a satin sheet
And get a little loud when we've had too much to drink
And learn to love from a church pew
Laugh about all the times we counted pennies
Buy some land with a good view to start family
Baby grow old with me

It's gonna take a little time
We'll have to work at it every day
We're gonna lose a lot of sleep
And learn to eat out of a microwave
You know we'll probably never have it all
But that's part of buildin' up the wall
Strong enough to stand up through the rain

We'll make some love on your favorite beach
Add to the house that we found in the city limits
Talk our babies through the bad dreams
When they get a little older we'll tell them not to drink
Book a church when she finds a groom
Laugh about all the times they'll count the pennies
Give em land with a good view to start a family

And baby you know we might
Take a turn on a bad road
Maybe go where the wind blows, baby
But end up right where we were meant to be, yeah
Back and forth on a porch swing
Hard not to smile thinkin' how it don't get much better
Our baby's baby's turnin' 18
What a family, hmmm

Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Baby grow old with me
Tell me that you love me
Say we'll always work it out
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
Ain't nothin' in the world gonna slow me down
I've been waitin' on this for such a long, long time
I've been waitin' on a chance girl to make you mine
Your body's burnin' me, turnin' me inside out
I want you so bad, all that I can think about
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
When I get my hands on you, yeah
We've been dancin' around this for way to long
Now I don't care if it's right or wrong
Just say the word and we're gonna be on our way
You're like a work of art, baby and I can't wait
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna do every little everything, anything girl
That you want me to, when it's finally just you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
I'm gonna make you go crazy baby
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna hold you close, never let go
Just the way that you want me to
Yeah, cause it's all about you and me
We'll let tonight turn tomorrow back into the night
Gonna make you go crazy, baby
When I get my hands on you
When I get my hands on you, yeah
If I get my hands on you, girl
When I get my hands on you
You were a whip around town
Tinted windows down
Alabama bound
Dixieland delight
You were a summer silhouette
A Sunday cigarette
A hand me down cassette
A turn on a dirt road dime
You were a rock that
Thrown back
George Strait tee too tight
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
I'm the Jack without the rocks
A sun without a drop
A quarter in the slot of an unplugged jukebox joint
And I'm a Gibson missin' all of my damn strings
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
It's like the record stopped spinning
And you're gone again and
I'm stuck here alone
Can't get you out of my head
Out of, out of my head
Out of my headphones
I turn it up, you turn me on
It takes me back
It takes all night long
Yeah it hard to admit it
Your boy is addicted
As soon as I hit it, it plays and I miss it
And now I'm tied to a train
Down memory lane
Stuck on repeat
Repeat the same old same
Can't get you out of my head, girl
Can't get you out of my head

Baby girl I'm caught up in your heatwave
You're hot like the end of June
It's not like you're gonna cool off soon
The spotlight looks good on you
It looks good on you
Shadows heat you like a headdress
Key to my heart on your necklace
Between summer girl and that sundress
I'm sweatin' and I'm reckless

Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drop a double shot in your Crystal Light
Midnight sweat, Cherokee skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby even if it's rainin'
Talk about a heat wave

Watch your body move to the beat babe
Feels like we're havin' us a beach day
Lightin' it up while your feet sway
I'm caught up in your heatwave
Heat wave, you're so fine
Heat wave, you're so fine
Heat wave, you're so fine
Heat wave, you're so fine

Baby girl I'm caught up in your
Two piece in the water
That's all me, I got her
There's gonna be some lightenin' at the bottom of this bottle
We have drawn our names in the white sand
Call it what it is, I'm the right man
Meltin' ice in your right hand
But I'ma put a rock on your left baby

Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drop a double shot in your Chrystal Light
Midnight sweat, Cherokee skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby
Even if it's rainin', talk about a heat wave

Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You don't stop this, turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You don't stop this, turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up

Moon dance in the starlight
Got two hands on your hips tonight
It's hot as hell but it's just right
Let me drop a double shot in your Chrystal Light
Midnight sweat, Cherokee skin
Can't cool off on a cold even
Love this love we're makin' baby
Even if it's rainin', talk about a heat wave

Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You don't stop this, turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up
Burnin' up, baby you've got me burnin' up
You don't stop this, turn it up
Love it any way you serve it up
Serve it up

Well, Daisy Duke, peek-a-boo
I might've learned a thing or two
On a Friday night joy ride
Out there on the county line
Drag racing 'til the blue lights chase us
And we scatter like sparks from a Black Cat fuse
Train bridge where we spray-paint Skynard
And the gold flakes glimmer in the cinnamon booze

We were living every minute of the night
Like there might never be another
We were running all the caution lights
We were learning to fly with a little tail gunner
If there was something to burn, we were burning it
Anything with a curve, we were turning it
Just wildfires out there under
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

Alabama on the alpine
Bust a cap on a deer sign
A little back seat butterfly
Homegrown angel that'll get you high


Yeah I see it clearer in the rear view mirror
Then I ever did looking out over the hood
Yeah man we had some damn good times
And I sure hope everybody's doing good


The hell raisin' heat of the summer
The hell raisin' heat of the summer

Lets turn it up loud, mix it up strong
Lean it back slow, get your feel good on
Cut em off short, roll it up tight
Let it unwind tonight
Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the partys at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And dont look back cause

Heres to the good times, heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time

Well lay it all out, spray it on sweet
Carve it in oak and permanent ink
Park it way back, fog it on up
Singing oh, oh
Radio spilling from a single cab
She looks so good with her silver tabs
Hanging on a branch by the river
Thats a memory thatll get you when you look back

Heres to the good times, heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time

Drop down the top down on the Pontiac
Where ever you wind up is where the partys at
Break out the bottle of Bacardi black
And dont look back cause

Heres to the good times, heres to the sunshine
Heres to the ice you float your beer in
To the tops you pop and the tan lines disappearing
Oh my, my
Shes a little bit tipsy
Leans in for a kiss, shes stealing your heart just like a gypsy
And there you are just a drunken star, just falling in her eyes
Heres to the good times
While theres still time

When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness, all broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losin' hope
But somehow baby, you broke through and saved me

You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you

You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killin' my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singin' babe, hallelujah
We'll be touchin', we'll be touchin' heaven

You're an angel, tell me you're never leavin'
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you

I don't need the stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy

You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on lovin' you, high on lovin' you

You're the healin' hands where it used to hurt
You're my savin' grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy
I wake up to find myself
After all these years
And where all the time has gone
Still seems so unclear
Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
It brings out the worst in me
When you're not around
I miss the sound of your voice
The silence seems so loud
Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
I spent all my life
Looking for our innocence
I've got nothing to lose
One thing to prove
I won't make the same mistakes
Now I know
That everything will be ok
When I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say?
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Don't know why I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do zero to sixty in five point two
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Can't be late, I leave in plenty of time
Shakin' hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Oh, I hear a voice
That says I'm running behind
Better pick up my pace
It's a race and there ain't no room for someone in second place
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die B
Ut I'm in a hurry and don't know why
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, shawty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck
It's not your birthday!1

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, nigga
In the club all the time, nigga, so it's a problem pop off, nigga, G-Unit!

Yeah this place is wall to wall, can't barely move, takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
It's crazy here, this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe, cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

It's just me and you, back corner booth, we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and, yeah girl, you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby, let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

We might as well be on an island
Like we're the last two on this Earth
Like we're frozen here in time
Like it's empty here tonight

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island, yeah

You know Tommy going to trick his truck
Jack it up big time
Lift kit, chrome tip
Spit shining like a diamond
Game changed and the rain came
And we took it down a back road
Georgia clay mud hole, that is how these boys roll
Now it is late night underneath the moonlight
Everybody is feeling right, sipping on a bud light
Go on drop your tailgate, turn up your radio
I'ma build a bonfire, you can make yourself at home

Kick back, relax, you know we are just a bunch o hillbillies
Tip back a cup a Jack and throw your hands up with me

Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby, that is alright
It is our backwoods, boondocks roots; it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey, there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah, it is just what we do

You see Tommy called Jenny
And Jenny going to call the hotties
To tell them about the party
So do not forget the Bacardi
Time to get your buzz on and your love on
All night long
And if you play your hand right
You would not have to go home alone
Six string picking, solo cup sipping
And when the moments right
Grab your phone and get them digits
Cranking that Bocephus, we all good with Jesus
Come Sunday morning that preacher, he about to preach it
Kick back, relax and pass the good time moonshine
Who brought the party? Damn, that was Florida Georgia Line

Hey, we might look a little crazy tonight
Hey baby, that is alright
It is our backwoods, boondocks roots; it is just what we do
It is just what we do
Hey, there is no way to make this up
When it is running through your blood
There is no hiding the truth
It is just what we do
It is just what we do
Yeah, it is just what we do

Every time I look in your eyes
It's like you take me back to the islands
You got me mile high cause you're my little pilot
I'm smiling, no sand in the hour glass
We can let the hours pass, baby, cause you're timeless
It's easy living right beside you
We got it, whatever we go through, baby

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cervesa cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

See, it's a Monday through Friday, 365 celebration
A every day-cation
Let my kiss be an open invitation
See where it can take us and get our hearts racing
I love flying way up there with you
You keep the air up in my parachute, baby

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, let's have a party
Get it sounding like Marley in here
Serve the cervesa cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear

She is my morning sun and when the evening come
She's the moonlit sky, yeah
Truth is, this is how we belong
Happy people do it one and one, let your tear be gone
No need to worry, this love is forever young
The queen of my desire, you're my music from my song
The wood in on my fire, you're my fire that's never gone
Who feels it knows, FGL how it goes

Life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it
Let love keep us lifting, my dear
Turn up a summer tune, we're gonna kick it
Get it sounding like Hendrix in here
Serve the cervesa cause we wanna sip it
Not missing a moment we're giving
Cause life is a honeymoon, we're gonna live it

I'ma lifer

I can hear that rain fallin' on this tin roof
Girl after all we've been through
Feels like the calm after the storm
So what you say we take this sunday
Let me love you till it's monday
We'll go have a fun day and baby we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
I'm your man and you my lady

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer

Whatever we go through girl we're family
There's nothin' we can't do can we
Tether through the weather, got us better than before
We just gotta learn how to stay here
Build on the love we made here
Make more time for prayer and the man upstairs
Cause I believe we can move any mountain when we're good
I believe I ain't me without you walkin' out in that white dress
Life without you is lifeless
And I'm your man and you my lady

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer

The twists and turns
Sometimes the love can hurt ya
Sometimes it burns
The wait ain't always perfect
We'll just keep diggin'
Dig our feet into the dirt and we'll get back to us
We'll get back to us
We've been trippin' over the same shit
I'm over the who's to blame shit
We throwin' up a white flag
I'm dancin' with who I came with
Can't wait to see our kids
Hope they look just like you

Baby I'm a lifer I ain't goin' nowhere
Told you since day one I had to wife ya
Show the world that I just wanna love ya
Girl I don't wanna fight ya
Yeah you're the only one for me
God knows that I'm a product of George Strait
And dammit I love singing to you
I done check yes and gave my mama's ring to you
Ain't nobody was sighted
My arms can't get any wider
Baby I'ma, baby I'ma, baby I'ma lifer
I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer, I'ma lifer

There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
Just let 'em fall
There's somethin' about them raindrops, them raindrops
Just let 'em fall
Till the pain stops, till the pain stops, let 'em fall
Just let 'em fall

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on, like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned, like you ain't even gone

Sunset, twilight, friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun
Bullet going straight through a street sign

You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
Well the truth is, well the truth is

I still go riding around town
With the windows down and your feet up on my dash
Got your rays on and my hands back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on , like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned 
Like you ain't even gone 

Midnight calling me looking for trouble
Slipping them should have beens in my ear
Got me shooting down that girl's memory double
That blue eyes, summer smoke, sunburn red smile
Said you were leaving this town, got to runaway
I watched you run away, and girl you should have chased down

Those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
Cause the truth is, girl the truth is

I still riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hands back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on , like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned 
Like you ain't even gone 

Its a kiss from Katie on the swing set
When I was in 3rd grade
Teacher making me sit from recess
When I would mis-behave

Its a long haul to see my grandma
During the holidays
I can tell my momma loved Jesus
By the way that she said grace

Its a spring break
For me and my buddies that had to go our own way
Sunday, that I got saved
Its a class ring, that we never bought
Cause we thought we'd win state
But it didn't turn out that way
I can't complain, Its how I became
The man I am today

Its a fast lane headed down the interstate
A long way from home

Loaded down with a truck full of memories
The only thing I've ever owned
Its a late night, bar fights coming in
Getting pizza at 3 am

Falling in and out of love with my girlfriend
Asking God to forgive my sins again
And again

It's the four years, everybody says your supposed to find yourself
And they were the best

There's the lonely tears
That I cried that night when I saw my dad die
But I know he's in a better place
So I can't complain, its how I became
The man I am today
Heyy

Cause the good Lord always seems to have a funny way
Of making you look back on your life and say
Its the white dress, walking down the isle the day I said I do
Watching our boy take his first breath

Its the true love, that made it through the years
And started on a swing set, I know that I am truly blessed

So I can't complain, I wouldn't change a thing
Its how I became
The man I am today
The man I am today
Its a kiss from Katie on the swing set, when I was in 3rd grade

May we all get to grow up in our red white and blue little town
Get a won't start hand me down Ford to try to fix up
With some part time cash from driving a tractor
Find a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards
Kinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does
Cause you miss it too much

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
Hope you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

May we all get to see those fields of green turn gold
Watch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up
And know that fifteen minutes of famous
Ain't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but
We'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes

May we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off
The sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox
Play the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac
'Fore you get lost down some road
Slow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco
Buy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto
She's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window
Where you 'bout to go?
Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

May we all do a little bit better than the first time
Learn a little something from the worst times
Get a little stronger from the hurt times
May we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one
Walk away wiser when we crashed one
Keep hoping that the best one is the last one

Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all
May we all 
May we all 
May we all 

Yeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall
May we all

Tears on a six string
Another angel gone
Leavin' you all alone
Dealin' with your demons
I know you layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah I know what you goin' through

If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

And there's a lot of souls lookin' for the high road
Everybody's needin'
Maybe just a little simple melody
Is all we need to keep our boomin' hearts beatin' true
And get the whole world in tune

If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

Yeah I know in my heart of hearts
That we're where we're supposed to be
And everybody's got the scars
But we can live in harmony, yeah

When you're layin' there wonderin'
If your prayers ever make it through the ceilin' too
Yeah I know what you goin' through

If I could write the perfect song
Make a little right out of all the wrongs
Would you close your eyes?
Would you let it in?
Would you light your candle against the wind?
If I could sing the perfect words
And change the world, unhurt the hurt
That we're all feelin'
Stop the bleedin'
Get back to believin'
Love is the answer and music is healin'

It was late July in that photograph
I could see her smile, hear her laugh
Feel our bare feet, in the sand
Holdin' on to each other's hand
Sunlight dancin' off her pretty face
Man, those were the days
Been washed away like our names in the sand with the waves

She had my heart
At seventeen
Now all I've got
Is her memory
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone when i never let her go

Sometime when the wind is right
I can see us there on a summer night
With a blanket down, looking up at the starry sky
So in love that goodnight kiss never felt so sweet
Didn't know that'd be the last there'd be
But like the leaves, on an autumn tree
When the summer's gone, so was she

She had my heart
At seventeen
Now all I've got
Is her memory
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone when I never let her go

I just know she's out there somewhere
Living life with no regrets
I wish I could say the same for me
But I ain't got there

She's had my heart
Since seventeen
Man I fell so hard
I lost everything
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone
She had my heart
At seventeen
Now all I've got
Is her memory
Where she is now
I just don't know
How she got gone when I never let her go
Never let her go

It was late July in that photograph
I could see her smile, hear her laugh

Well she always had a way of getting her way
We could never work out if I wasn't willing to change
It was always my hair, my clothes, my hat
She hated my job, my dog, my dad
Even the way that I said grace
I couldn't be me for so long
I feel free now that she's gone

Gonna grow my hair out and buy a Harley
Get that tattoo I always wanted
Take off working night shift for a couple weeks
Live my life with a simple mission "have more fun, do a lot more fishing"
Hang out with my boys cause it's been too long
I'm gonna do whatever I want now that she's gone

Now I can see why I'm not the man she wanted me to be
How could I believe all the lines she fed to me
It was always eat this and don't drink that
Who are you with, where the hell are you at
You better be home by 9:15
I couldn't be me for so long
But I feel free now that she's gone


No more late night chick flicks
Spending all of my money just to earn a kiss
Walk a mile to the mall for the perfect pair of jeans
Spending all the days kissing ass to her family
Yeah, yeah

I'm gonna grow my hair out and buy a Harley
Get that tattoo I've always wanted
Take off working night shift for a couple weeks
Live my life with a simple mission "have more fun, do a lot more fishing"
Hang out with my boys cause it's been too long
I'm gonna do whatever I want
I'm gonna do whatever I want, yeah
I'm gonna do whatever I want now that she's gone
Now that she's gone
Woo oh oh oh

Put the stereo on the roof and crank the JBLs
Give me something with a backbeat with country in the rap beat
Twist it on up to 10
And if neighbors disapprove
Well they can go to Helena, Montana
Or you can grab a case of beer and baby come on in

We'll be spinning 'til the streetlights
Looking like a strobe light
'Til we're feeling alright
Gonna do it all night

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh, let's go
Well, come on
Yeah, we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot, shots
Someone tell the clock, clock
We ain't gonna stop, stop
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, let's go

Call your ten best looking friends
Tell them to call ten more
I got enough yard for all y'all to park
Just bring your own cup for the keg
Tell 'em look for the disco ball
Spinning round on my porch
We'll be popping off tops in the hot tub truck bed
Make a few waves, that's enough said

Gonna get buck wild
Get a little buzz on
David Lee Roth style
Might as well jump, jump

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh, let's go
Well, come on
Yeah, we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot, shots
Someone tell the clock, clock
We ain't gonna stop, stop
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, let's go

Yeah we've been working
Let's make the weekend worth it
Party 'til it's hurting
Then we'll do it some more

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Monday's so far away
All my party people
Oh, let's go
Well, come on
Yeah, we're gonna rock rock
Do a lotta shot, shots
Someone tell the clock, clock
We ain't gonna stop, stop
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Where my party people
Oh, let's go
This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya

Ain't gonna let you down

Just wanna make you proud
This is for my people back home
My people back home
My people back home
See this one's for my people
From the backwoods to the steeple
From my daddy and that preacher man
That taught me to run from evil
From the people that I'm still so cool with
And the people that I went to school with
From the boys I ran around and stomped them grounds and broke them rules with
This one's for my family and the way that I was raised
And now my life's another city, another picture, another stage
But I hope you know I miss ya
And part of me's still with ya
And no matter where I go or what I do I won't forget ya
This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya

Ain't gonna let you down

Just wanna make you proud
This is for my people back home
My people back home
My people back home
This is for the one's who believed in me
For the one's who took the time to breathe the life in me
You got my heart beating inside of me
You made me what I tried to be
For the one's who love my music
Said you could do it, if you choose this
So we dreamed big and we worked hard
Now we got the whole world cruisin'
This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya

Ain't gonna let you down

Just wanna make you proud
This is for my people back home
My people back home
My people back home
For my brother and my sister
For my mama yeah I miss her
For the one that got away
Damn, I should have kissed her
For my best friends and my cousins
And that town that we grew up in
If it wasn't for all of ya'll
This ole boy would be nothing
You're running through our hearts
You did it from the start
Yeah you know who you are
You're in every song I sing
You're in every dream I dream
You're the beat inside of me
This is for my people back home
We're lighting one up, feel the love
We wouldn't be here without ya
This is for my people back home
Mix it strong, pour it out no doubt
We're always thinking about ya

Ain't gonna let you down

Just wanna make you proud
This is for my people back home
My people back home
My people back home

Hammer and a nail, stacking them bales
I'm dog tired by the 5:00 hour
But I'm ready to raise some hell
And Jesse's getting ready, I'm gassing up the Chevy
I'm gonna pick her up at six
I hope she's gonna wear the jeans with the tear
That her mama never fixed

The moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah that's how we do it 'round here

Mud on the grips, wild cherry on her lips
I've been working and trying and flirting and dying
For an all night kinda kiss
Country on the boombox, candles on the tool box
I'm doing everything right, got the country boy charm
Turned all the way on tonight
 x2
Yeah the moon comes up and the sun goes down
We find a little spot on the edge of town
Twist off, sip a little, pass it around
Dance in the dust, turn the radio up
That fireball whiskey whispers
Temptation in my ear
It's a feelin' alright, Saturday night
And that's how we do it 'round here
Yeah that's how we do it 'round here

Yeah that's how we do it round here
Yeah that's how we do it round here

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire

You act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feeling when we're burning the midnight down again

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire

Every goodbye is bitter sweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters 
Get a little higher 
Sippin' on fire

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again
Got on my smell good, got a bottle of feel good
Shining my wheels good, you're looking real good
Take a stack of cash out, I'm bout to blast out
Til I run the gas out, I'm going all out
All I want to see is you have a good time
No I don't care if it takes me all night
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile
I'll take you out there, in the middle of nowhere
Let down your blonde hair, breathe in that midnight air
Girl we can take a trip, to the river and take a sip
Do a little back flip and kiss kiss kiss your lips
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile
Girl I just want to make you dance
Give you the best night you ever had
Oh, and girl I want it bad, bad, bad
I'll give anything to see you look that way
Give me that little love on your pretty face
All I'm waiting is for is for you to just
Lay your pretty head on my shoulder
For a while and find your jam on my radio dial
Girl all I want, is just to see you smile
That pretty little smile

Laying back against this windshield
Parked out in this Georgia red field
This is where we burn our summer nights
Moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that Tacoma
We were seventeen, going on free and wild

She was smoking hot, a whiskey shot, a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

I'm sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

July flames, October ashes
Southern skin and blue jean flashes
Strike a match and light a memory
We never said goodbye, we let it fly into thin air
Tonight I'm stoned on long-gone love so strong I swear

I'm sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke

She was smoking hot, a whiskey shot, a cherry coke
Sparks were flying every time I smelled smoke

I'm sitting by a bonfire watching her swaying
Me and my buddies and the guitar playing
Sipping on forties on a Saturday night
Buzzing through a chorus of 'Dixieland Delight'
High as the stars in the Milky Way
Those summer days drifted away
But she'll always float
Back through my mind like smoke
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Smooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis
Singing Gospel it's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
That do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smooth
Like cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzing
Off an old camp bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the window
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody

That do me like you

The way you move that body

Girl, you're so smooth

Smooth, smooth
You're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jam
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody

That do me like you

The way you move that body

Girl, you're so smooth

Smooth, smooth

Smooth

I'd sell my soul just to see your face
And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
In these times I need a saving grace
But time is running out
And I'm starting to lose my faith

But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

My heart's on my sleeve but it's turning black
I guess I know what it feels like it to be alone
Without your touch I'm not gonna last
I know you know that I need ya just to carry on
It feels like my walls are caving in
You'd always hold me before I left you hanging on
And I'll do anything to have you here again

But if I told you I loved you
Would it make you want to stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you
And making you walk away
I should have took the time to tell you
And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl you gotta know I love you

Yeah, the days are cold
The nights are long
I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault
And all I want is to tell you I love you
And make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way
Cause going on without you is killing me everyday

And if I wrote you a love song
And sang it to you every day
Would it ever be enough
To make you wanna come back home and stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
Girl, you gotta know I love you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay
I can't go another day without you
Would it make you, make you wanna stay

Sky on a break, break down
Ghost town, shake down beach
Good vibes, blowin' in that Gulf Shore breeze
Saltwater skinny dip waitin' on me
It's hotter in the water, good Lord
Ain't no doubt, 'bout to lay you down on a beach towel
California king style
Gonna do it all night, baby

Big stars shinin' over Summerland
Sunburnt love with a a southern man
Baby, right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly, yeah, I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood, Shiner bock, kissin' on the dock
Big dipper, slow dance
With my hands where the sun don't tan
Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time, baby, we'll be slippin' off to Summerland

Lay it on back, back to the back of that ragtop Jeep
Blame it on the waves, we ain't geting no sleep
Fireside crackle kiss, plant it on my cheek
Lips on a bottle
I know you ain't a model, but you should be a model
I'm gonna kiss you to till tomorrow
And I'm gonna do it all night, baby

Big stars shinin' over Summerland
Sunburnt love with a a southern man
Baby, right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly, yeah, I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood, Shiner bock, kissing on the dock
Big dipper, slow dance
With my hands where the sun don't tan
Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time, baby, we'll be slippin' off to Summerland

Ain't no doubt, 'bout to lay you down on a beach towel
California king style
Gonna do it all night, baby

Big stars shinin' over Summerland
Sunburn love with a a southern man
Baby, right now I'm high as a kite
Seabirds fly, yeah, I just might tonight
Gypsy driftwood, Shiner bock, kissin' on the dock
Big dipper, slow dance
With my hands where the sun don't tan
Don't you worry 'bout the sand
In no time, baby, we'll be slippin' off to Summerland

The sky on a break, break down
Ghost town, shake down beach
Good vibes blowin' in that Gulf Shore breeze
I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going, the keg gon' be floating
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

What'd he do this time?
Did he break your heart?
I can tell you been crying... and baby here you are
And I always know any time you show up at my door past 11 o'clock that he really must've pissed you off

Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take...

Take off your coat, and baby come on in
Girl, let me help to get back at him
And I don't know why you never say goodbye
Whatever hell he's putting' you through
I can't wait for you to...

Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me

Yeah, I'll lay you down and love you just the way you should be
Baby, so now that you're ready...
Take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take...

Take it out on me
And put your lips on mine
Let me take his wrong and make it right this time
Yeah, you can just come over, you ain't gotta call
You always got a shoulder anytime it all goes bad, when you're 'bout to break, when you're mad as hell, you can always take it out on me
You can take it out on me baby
If you ever wanna leave, maybe
In the middle of the night, that's alright...
You can take, take, take it out on me

Do you like it when the meter's jumping
You like the sound of them horses running
Do you like it when the tweeter's tweeting
Do you like it when the back seat's bumping
Do you like a little kick in your coke
Do you like it goin' up in smoke
Do you like it on a gravel road
We can keep it on the down low

Tell me how you like it, tell me how you like it
You know I wanna try it, know I wanna try it
Baby if you don't mind it, if you don't mind it
We can kick it down in four and you can drive
Pretty girl you can ride it
We can all night it, we can all night it
You don't have to hide it, you don't have to hide it
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it

Do you like it on a riverbank
Do you like it when the sun done sank
Do you like it when the full moon's high
And it's shinin' down into your drink
Do you like it when the tailgate's down
Do you like it when we take it to the ground
Tell me baby, how does that sound
Either way, you know it's going down


Baby, why you gotta look so pretty
With your hair so soft and long
You're damn sure turnin' me on
Tonight, we gettin' out of the city
Leave it all behind, get a little lost
Baby you make the call


Do you like it in the shotgun seat
With the highway flyin' right under your feet
Do you like it with the radio on
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
Do you like it by the bonfire heat
If it gets too hot, we can take it to the creek
I need to know
Let's make it last all night long
Just tell me how
Tell me how you like it
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
A little bit of Southern on the rocks
A little bit of Skynyrd on the box
A little bit of running from the cops
A pretty thing in a tank top
Flashing red lights, run on through it
Find the city limits sign and lose it
Baby you a song, so sing along to it
'Cause you know how we do
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck

Come on
Well let me tell you 'bout my town
This field of dreams
I'm hooked as my Nicotine, uh
Holds me together like the seams on my jeans
And damn I can't leave, no I'm never gonna leave
It's even better than Alabama's Greatest Hits
A little mixtape you can jam along with
My kin, my friends, that's a long list
The water towers got all our names carved in
When the sun comes up
We party down
We got that music way up loud
And all the girls
Hanging out of the truck
Singing hey, that's what's up
We twist that top, pass it around

To the one you love
Get your lighters up
Baby that's what's up
If you need to boom
You know we brought the beat box
And if you need to rise
We about to blow the damn roof off
We got small town pride
Getting way too loud
'Cause it's in our blood
Baby that's what's up
Come on

The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back

If you roll with me, yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh

When you got a rocking chair
On your front porch, tip it back

Ball cap, tip it back

When you're parked back off a dirt road
In your girlfriend's Cadillac
Find that button on the front seat
And tip it back, aw yeah

Grab a long-neck if you are with me
Come on now, holler "Hell yeah"
Because tonight we are here to party
And do not worry about anything
Except what is in your glass
Whether it is a cold beer, tequila
Or a double shot of Jack
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back

Tell them about it, BK
When that bar keep brings you change
Just tip it back
When you are two stepping
With your baby, man, tip her back

When you do not get paid for next week
But you need some drinking cash
Find that coffee can stash and
Tip it back, come on, baby


Put that bottle to your lip
Take a sip, man, tip it back
Tie a cherry stem knot
With your tongue, girl, tip it back

If you like a pineapple
Coconut rum, baby, tip it back
If you got a home grown
Moonshine flask you all, tip it back
Come on


And do not worry about anything
Except what is in your glass
Whether it is a cold beer, tequila
Or a double shot of Jack

Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Yeah, all you need to do tonight is tip it back
Yeah tip it back, yeah tip it back
Alright

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today
Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars
Are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

Adios en  vaya con dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios en vaya con dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
Four days flew by
Like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe
That I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Because my bartender -- she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

Adios en vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Yeah, and all the muchachas -- they call me "big poppa"
When I throw pesos their way
Adios en vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Hey, boss, do me a favor and pass me the Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Adios en vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
Cause senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
You got no money to stay
Adios en vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
Just gonna drive up by the lake
With my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today. Life is good today

Was Friday after five, I got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than Cain
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here

Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, get hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here

Somebody pass that fifth of Cap this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down here
Hey girl, what's a girl like you
Doin' in a place like this?
With lipstick on the edge
Of your cocktail glass
You took a sip and it was gone so fast
Looks to me like
You might need another one
A double one, yeah me too
You're too pretty to look so blue
I hope you don't mind me asking you girl
What are you drinkin' about tonight?
Are you shootin' down some old love?
Baby that makes two of us
In the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey
And a little bit of coke
And a whole lot of lonely too
What are you drinkin' 'bout?
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout you
Hey girl, what's a girl like you
Doing here feelin' like me?
Memories, on the edge
Of your cocktail glass
With every sip they're fading so fast
Looks to me like
You might need another one
A double one, yeah me too
I'm already forgettin' 'bout who
Broke my heart when
I'm lookin' at you girl
What are you drinkin' about tonight?
Are you shootin' down some old love?
Baby that makes two of us
In the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey
And a little bit of coke
And a whole lot of lonely too
What are you drinkin' 'bout?
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout you
You and me gettin' outta here, disappear
Headed south where the coast is clear
Forget about him, forget about her
And all the never were's, never were's
Never were meant to be's
So baby look in my eyes and tell me
What are you drinkin' about tonight?
Are you shootin' down some old love?
Baby that makes two of us
In the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey
And a little bit of coke
And a whole lot of lonely too
What are you drinkin' 'bout?
'Cause baby I'm drinkin' 'bout you
What are you
What are you
What are you drinkin' 'bout baby?

Well hey girl, what's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
With lipstick on the edge of your cocktail glass, you took a sip and it was gone so fast
It looks to me like you might need another one, a double one, yeah me too
You're too pretty to look so blue, I hope you don't mind me asking you girl

What are you drinking about tonight?
Are you shooting down some old love?
Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too
What are you drinking 'bout?

Well hey girl, what's a girl like you doing here feeling like me?
Memories on the edge of your cocktail glass, with every sip they're fading so fast
It looks to me like you might need another one, a double one, yeah me too
I'm already forgetting 'bout who broke my heart when I'm looking at you girl

What are you drinking about tonight?

Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too
What are you drinking 'bout?
Cause baby I'm drinking 'bout

You and me getting outta here, disappear, headed south where the coast is clear
Forget about him, Forget about her
And all the never were's, never were's, never were meant to be's
So baby look in my eyes and tell me

What are you drinking about tonight?
Are you shooting down some old love?
Baby, that makes two of us in the same bar, in the same boat
A little bit of mistake, whiskey and a little bit of coke and a whole lot of lonely too

Cause baby I'm drinking 'bout you

What are you, what are you, what are you drinking 'bout baby?
What are you, what are you, what are you drinking 'bout baby?
What are you, what are you, what are you drinking 'bout baby?

While he's still around
I'm gonna take him out to fish
So we can catch up on those stories
That we ain't got to yet
And while he's still around
I'm gonna make a couple of notes
About how he's loved my mama
Since all those years ago

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven handed out some angel wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him
While he's still around

While he's still around
We're gonna fix up that old car
So one day when it's all mine
He'll be there every time it starts
And while he's still around
Yeah I want to meet the one
Watch him try and hold them tears back
When I see him holdin' my son

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven handed out some angel wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him
While he's still around

I'm gonna try and catch a game with him
Take a road trip, get on out of state with him
Make every memory I can make with him
Live it up before it's too late with him

Cause you never know when the phone is gonna ring
Sayin' heaven handed out some angel wings
And all those things that you were gonna do
Are just tear drops rainin' on a church pew
So I'm gonna try to say before I gotta pray it
Hopin' that he's lookin' down
And tell him that I love him
While he's still around

In your cup holder was some loose change
Ya got your cellphone on vibrate
I wish you were on it
There's a road you got to take to get to my place
Faded double yellow lines on a two lane
I wish you were on it

I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it


There's a parking spot under the sycamore
And the flood light on the front porch
I wish you were on it
And through the front door, up the stair case
There's a four post down the hall way
I wish you were on it

I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it


There's a heart that needs to unbreak
And you know the way

I could use a little you right now
Rushin' over, runnin' into my house
With want you back tears rollin' down your face
Drop your keys on my hardwood floor
Kiss me like you never kissed me before
And girl I swear that's all that it would take
And you know the way
I wish you were on it


If you're anything like me
You like jacked up trucks
Four-wheel drives
And loud straight pipes
And a big tool box
You like to ride around town
With the windows down
Singing 'Song of the South'
If you're anything like me
You're country!

Born and raised in the south
American and proud
Where the lost get found
Living off the land
And working with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cooking
Daddy's ass whipping
And Heaven bound
If youre anything like me 
Youre country

If youre anything like me
You like to cut off your sleeves
Show off your tattoos and your battle wounds
That you got last week
Brag to your boys
Bout the buck you killed
And the girl in your backseat
If youre anything like me
Youre country

Born and raised in the south
American and proud
Where the lost get found
Living off the land
And working with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cooking
Daddy's ass whipping
And Heaven bound
If youre anything like me 
Youre country

It's all about the moonshine
Midnight campfire
And singing on Saturday night
We go to church
Get right
Baby get baptized
We all see the light

Born and raised in the south
American and Proud
Where the lost get found
Living off of land, working with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cooking
Daddy's ass whipping
And heaven bound
If you're anything like me 
Born and raised in the south
American and proud
Where the lost get found
Living off of land
Working with our hands
Till the sun goes down
Mamas home cooking
Daddy's ass whipping
And Heaven bound

If you're anything like me 
If ya play a 6 string 
If you got a skull ring 
If you're anything like me 
You're country!
Country!

Wheels turn like my memories
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-bes
And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone

A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now Im going to hit my knees
Say I miss you ooh I love you and Im sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, all my fears
Are a hundred miles from here

I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didnt know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more


She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight
She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it arent right
So if he won't call, she'll survive
And if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should've told you before

She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out again
She doesn't know which way to move
Oh no

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
If she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard

She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge, about to fall from leaning out again
She doesn't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool because she don't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool
Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
But you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Mmhmm, just a girl, just a girl

Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with a guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can
Stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that

And Im just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "aint she beautiful?"
Im invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing theyre seein'
But I dont mind being the guy with the girl, no

It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room

And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "aint she beautiful?"
Im invisible, but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing theyre seein'
But I dont mind being the guy with the girl

The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gon' let her, never gon' let her go
Woah-oh, yeah

Im just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "aint she beautiful?"
Im invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing theyre seein'
But I dont mind being the guy with the girl


No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl

Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it baby
I don't mind it baby
I'm always the guy with the girl
You make the coffee
I try and doctor it up
A little cream and some sugar
And I think about us
Arent it just like me
Not to say what I should
It arent that bad
It just arent that good
There's no way you don't notice
The silence we share
Afraid what's come between us
Has always been there
Just somewhere the truth
Got misunderstood
No, it arent that bad
It just arent that good
So we go on
Going through the motions
Holding on
To some crazy notion
That we're not afraid of being alone
Yeah, we go on
Going through the motions
Holding on
To some crazy notion
That we're not afraid of being alone
I've packed up and left you
In the back of my mind
I'm sure you've done the same
A couple of times
The truth is by now
I thought one of us would
Guess it arent that bad
It just arent that good
No, we don't say goodbye
Though we probably should
Guess it arent that bad
It just arent that good


Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feel-good pills and a red gatorade by my bed
Ready to go
I'm going to do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab climb in a cab
Heading to a spot downtown

It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some wildest buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends
Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next Saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away

Ha-ha slide

It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on it's all about tonight
We're going to get our swerve on a buzz on
It's all about tonight
Come on baby I wouldn't worry about that
It's all about tonight

There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw

She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

The sky is blue
But from where I stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What I wouldn't give if I could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again


I played some Stones and Skynyrd songs
Last night on the jukebox
And I'm gettin' back to hatin' me some soft rock
I don't almost reck' seein' if its you
Every time a midnight blue Pontiac
Pulls into the parkin' lot
Believe it or not

I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
I'm kind of okay
With you out of my life
I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
Alright

I took down most the magnets
And pictures of us in Cabo
I forgot my 'fridgerator
Was avocado 
And I still might call every now and then
Way too late, just checkin' in
Tellin' you how good its been to let go
Aww, and baby to let you know


I might get a little sideways
Yeah, but what do you expect?
I might have a few bad days
I'm figuring out its for the best

I'm almost alright
I'm just about fine
I barely wanna break his nose when I see you with another guy
Would it be kind of okay
If I came by tonight?
Oh, I'm absotively, posolutely, almost alright
Yeah, I'm posolutely, absotutely almost alright

Alright
Almost alright
Hey, can I come over tonight, baby?
Ha-ha!
Anyone else would shake my hand
Wish me luck, be proud for a friend
But a jealous guy won't share the sun
When it feels threatened by anyone
Yeah, anyone else would open the door
Helping me find what I was looking for
When you smile there's always a catch
Like I didn't earn everything I have
 why do you always wanna put me down
 when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?
Cause nobody else would make me feel dumb
For being myself or needing someone
And I can't tell, are you ever sincere?
Did they treat you like this when you showed up here?
 why do you always wanna put me down
 when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?
 why do you always wanna put me down
 when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, you want it all
And you want everyone to see
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?

The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't want to leave your side
For that lonesome road but here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel
Of fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Still I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair
And your kiss, Girl, that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know


And I'll ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
On a ride that won't let me go
Don't need no tab, don't need no VISA
No bouncer looking like a wannabe Vin Diesel
Don't need your friends all getting jealous
Watching you walk in looking so good that you could sell it
Uh-uh, not again
Girl, let's get this party started where the party always ends
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, star-gazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house
At the house
Yeah, that's what it's all about
Don't need no plans , no reservations 
Nobody calling me up, saying, "where you at, man? We waiting"
We can keep it on chill , or get a little obnoxious 
Go ahead and get your freak on, ain't nobody gonna stop us
Uh-uh, girl, just the essentials
You and me, a little Smithworks
Rockin' out this residential
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, star-gazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house
Uh-uh, not again
Girl, lets get this party started where the party always ends
Got a yellow backdoor porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swaying, star-gazing
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch
At the house
Yeah, at the house
That's what it's all about
Mmm, yeah
At the house

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you

This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God, I'm such a mess
Never a morning person, but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tangling - her little arm is dangling
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leaving
She didn't believe the words I said

I ain't ever going
I ain't ever going
I ain't ever going
Back there, again

She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See, I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe, whisper my name


No one's going to make me
Nothing's going to take me
I ain't ever going
Back there, again
Now, don't blame her mama - for making me promise
Don't come around here, no more
She said, "maybe your life's gone to hell
But, that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for"
When you can't save yourself, you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm running away so she don't have to see
A life in slow-motion suicide
You throw in the towel - they call you a coward
Tell you  - fight, don't cut and run
I arent no hero, but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Should have become

I ain't ever going
I ain't ever going
I ain't ever going

No one's going to make me
Nothing's going to take me
I ain't ever going
Going
To break her heart, again

Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whopper wheel started to sing
So I slipped down the hill
Got into the still
And drank till my ears started to ring
I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
Its my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
Its time that we got to no good

Now I arent afraid to be lonely
But I still want to learn about love
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug

My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said thats where bad people go
But me and my sister been talking
Shes eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe

Now I arent afraid to be lonely
But I still want to learn about love
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug

Now I need a woman

And I need a man

We arent got nobody
An' we arent even kin
Now I arent afraid to be lonely
But I still want to learn about love
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug
Come lay down on my bare skin rug

Without even tryin' when I close my eyes
I see you walking 'round inside of my head
Looking up at the sky shining brighter than the single sunrise
It's every been red

And I wanna hold you hold you
Holding in the warm sunshine
If I never told you told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna
Dance with my baby in the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving to the daylght
And I'll be right beside you babe 'til the end of time

I been bragging about you baby
You can bet I've been calling up all of my friends
Don't you know I've been counting down the days
Feeling just crazy enough to call up your old man

And I wanna hold you hold you
Holding in the warm sunshine
If I never told you told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna
Dance with my baby in the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving to the daylght
I'll be right beside you babe till the end of time


And I wanna hold you hold you
Holding in the warm sunshine
If I never told you told you
I'm giving you the rest of my life

'Cause we got the fire tonight
And it makes me wanna
Dance with my baby in the dead of the night
Just keep on moving and grooving to the daylght
And I'll be right beside you babe till the end of time
I wanna hold you hold you

Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone

I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
Theres just something about you baby
Theres nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldnt hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you  outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...

I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
Theres just something about you baby
Theres nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free

I know we couldnt hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Yeah I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Ill have a blue Christmas without you
Ill be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Wont be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
Youll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas


Youll be doing all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
Red red red red red red red red redneck

Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ol' Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At the honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night, what

Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your 4 wheel drive
A country boy can survive

Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
You don't do the dougie?

Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

Been forever since I've been gone
Haven't held you in so long
Miss you more than words can say
Guess we've got a little off track
But love knows a way back
Through the storms and pouring rain
Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh
Every moment, every sweet kiss
All the loving that we both missed
It's okay to let em go
Yesterday's all forgotten
And today we start rocking
Somewhere underneath the rainbow
Got my hands on the wheel and I'm flying
Heart beat loud as the thunder rolls
Lightning on the stampede of lightning roll
I'm bringing back the sunshine
Bringing back the sunshine
Baby, it's about time, oh
Oh yeah, bringing back, oh

Work, work, work, man that's all I ever do
Been hitting it, getting it, giving it, living them working man blues
Working on that pick-up, working on that check
Working on that twerking, man it still ain't working yet
Hey, can I get a little, "Hey man"
Anybody been where I've been
It just don't stop when you punch that clock
Gotta rock on right through the weekend
Gotta keep on keeping on, gotta keep that percolator perking
Got a wheel, got a way, got a hang, got a how
And right now I'm just working on a big buzz
Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-buzzin
Mm, baby girl when you get a few in you
Don't you know that you tend to get a little wild

When you're shooting that fireball whiskey
Get to getting all fireball frisky, you a hot little jockey
Nothing rocks me like you rocking me on a big buzz
Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice
I'll be b-b-b-b-buzzin, b-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin b-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin
Alright
B-b-b-b-buzzin
B-b-b-b-buzzin baby
Buzzin

Girl you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget 
Just what we came here to forget

Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're getting through

Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget

I saw you sitting there sipping red wine down at Causen Mills
I knew you'd probably be outta my league but I thought, what the hell?
Aw, what the hell
Five dollars a glass was kicking my butt but I kept on buying
I kind of thought you were into me
So I kept on trying to get them sparks a 'flying'

In my forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
All I had to my name was a big old truck and a little old place
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Ho-ho-ho

I asked you if you ever stared up at the stars from a tailgate
Down by the river with a six pack
You said no, but it sure sounds great
You climbed up in my old truck
Sitting' right beside me
I cranked up a country song
And you started smiling
Yeah, this old boy was styling

In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, I missed work for three days
Kissing' on you, didn't get paid
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Ho-ho-ho

We been together ever since that night
You're still in love with that same old guy
Same old guy

In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, we set a date for next spring
Working two jobs, picking out rings
I can't help but think
I can't afford to love you
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Ho-ho-ho

I can't afford not to
Love on you
There's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There ain't no drinkin on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights comin' through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
With a Buffard T kinda law man closin' in
She just keeps on rockin guess i better do some talkin
She's too dumb to run n' i'm too drunk to swim
This can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good
Aww stay tuned...
This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good
Everybody is runnin like the end of the world was comin
With a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rockin', babe there ain't no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumpin in...
Now you know, when we get to the other side, were gonna have to take all
These wet clothes off, and hang out awhile... you know, this could be good
Yea!
Its two a.m
And this old bar is closing
He knows the partners
Have been chosen
But in the corner both
He spots lonely youth
And he catches her eye
And he moves fast
And says my name is Steven
Guess I blew my chance
Since everyone is leaving
She stands up to go
Never says hello
But she never says goodbye
Then she smiles and
Leans her head back
Towards the door
And as she takes his hand
His jaw falls to the floor
Now we all take chances
Every once in a while
We take chances
If its just to ease our minds
We all take chances
Wrong or right
Ah but sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Morning light comes shining throw her window
She wakes just in time to hear him go
She curls up in bed
Hands on her head
Tears in her eyes
She relives the night they spend together
Shouts out loud "Lord knows I knew better!"
Then she hears a sound
Slips on her gown
Takes a look outside
With coffee and flowers
He walks toward the door
And as he says "Good Morning"
Her jaw falls to the floor
Now we all take chances
Every once in a while
We take chances
If it's just to ease our minds
We all take chances
Wrong or Right
Ah but sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Yeah sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Mmm hmmm mmm mmmm mmm

Been wound up tighter than a banjo string
Price of gas groceries and all those things
They sound little till you add them all up
Then you really feel the crunch
Man, I've had enough

I need to chill, give it a rest
Get down to the lake with a full ice chest
And chill, and let a cold corona
Lift this world right off my shoulders
Lime in the water, steak on the grill
I think it's way past time for me to chill
Just chill

This morning 65 was a parking lot
Bumper to bumper just start and stop
Sometimes I think we're like a bunch of rats
Getting caught in our own traps
Well, I say to hell with that


Before we go to therapy and take another pill
We just need to chill, give it a rest
Lay down in a hammock and take a deep breath
And chill, it don't cost a dime
To reel in your troubles and just unwind
Cork in the water and time to kill
You can't tell me this arent a great way to chill
Just chill

Man, I need to chill
Just chill
I cant see in this darkness
So in need of forgiveness
Before all of my faith dies
Show me the way like a northern light
Come find me cause I cant find myself

Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But Im feeling lost can you save me
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
Dont know how I got where I am
Hurting so much I need healing
All I have is what I can pray
Send me your mercy I need your grace

Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But Im feeling lost can you save me
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
Come find me cause I cant find myself

Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
All over the world the angels sing
But Im feeling lost can you save me
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve
Im looking for you on Christmas Eve

On a Mississippi morning
My dad yelled out a warning
Son you better hit that cotton patch soon
And on my way down to the field
As I passed Old Johnson's Mill
I saw Becky Morgan, skinny dipping nude
Well I couldn't help but stop and stare
Hypnotized I stood right there
Enchanted by the beauty that I'd seen
Then she gave me a come in smile
Nearly drove my body wild
I fell down trying to kick off my jeans

Well on that cotton picking morning
I met up with Becky Morgan
You know that day I didn't get to work on time
And in the days of my December
I know I both remember
Sowing oats at cotton picking time

Well I lost my job that summer
But I guess I had it coming
Cause that picking cotton just wasn't on my mind
But you don't need too much money
When you got a Tupelo honey
Keeping you cool in the Mississippi hot sunshine


We've come a long way since then
Now I own that cotton gin
And I bought that mill
Just to make her smile
And to keep our love from growing old
We still go down there to that hole
Skinny dip and Becky is just as wild


We were sowing oats at cotton picking time
We were sowing oats at cotton picking time

You ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing
Like a broken record skipping down on main
Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
You know what I mean
Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints, jumping on the county line
Heard them sing about it a million times
But I don't mind

As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that slide guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we rock, and that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio

There's always going to be a party out in the pines
Always going to be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time
There's always going to be people trying to run us down
Saying we arent got nothing on a big town
I bet they'd come around
If they came on down


There's always going to be a part of me
Kicking back in BFE
Yeah, that's how it's always going to be


Some country on the radio
As long as there's a small town
Saturday nights
Blue jean babies
Yeah, tip back your Dixie
Stealing those kisses

Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Making that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from chopping cotton, cutting corn and slinging that hay
Been heavy lifting since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the morning yawning with those work boots on
Working like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Driving cattle, roping steers and burning his brand
There ain't no letting up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the morning yawning with those Tony Llama's on
Working like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him going, keeps him going

She's up in the morning yawning with that coffee pot on
Working like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones
No doubt about it that girl's country strong

Cowboys, plowboys, good hearted women
They're all country strong

I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well here I am
It arent no big surprise
You got a broken heart to kill
Tired of knowing how it feels
When you learn you been living
A lie
Oh, and arent that a shame
You shouldn't feel such pain

But you can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside you
And find the one that's never going to let you down
Mm, mm, mm

So go ahead and take your shot
Drink your whiskey on the rocks
And tell me how
You'll never find the one
But Lord knows it hurts me bad
Every time I see you sad
Knowing that my love
Goes on and on
Oh, it just arent right
You're alone tonight

Mm, mm, mm

You can't blame no one but you, Delilah
For what you find when you never ever look around
Reach out for the one right here beside you
And find the one that's never going to let you down
Mm, mm, mm
I knew the moment that you walked in
You were looking for your old friend
Well, here I am
It arent no big surprise

My alarm clock is a radio
95.5 gets me ready to go
Im heading to my job, drinking coffee strong
And Im doing it to country songs
Around oh, 5:30 my buddies and I
Hit the watering hole cause our whistles are dry
Drinking beer, shooting pool, man you cant go wrong
Doing it to country songs

I like doing it to country songs
I like doing it to country songs
Doing it to country songs
Doing it to country songs

Well I call up my baby, she says come pick me up
I take her out dancing in my pickup truck
We rub them belt buckles til they shine like chrome
Doing it to country songs

She likes doing it to country songs
She likes doing it to country songs
Doing it to country songs
Doing it to country songs
Yup

Oh haha, son, that's doing it right there

Yeah we like doing it to country songs
We like doing it to country songs

Everybody,  doing it to country songs
We like doing it to country songs

Doing it to country songs
Doing it to country songs

Doing it to country songs

Doing it to country songs

Doing it to country songs

Doing it to country songs
Yeah, woo


She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hanging with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doing what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throwing words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doing what she likes
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doing what she likes
Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

Yeah, I like doing what she likes
Hmm, yeah

Girl when I look at you, you look through me
Like I'm not even there
I try not to give up, to be strong but
I'm afraid to say I'm scared
I can't find the place, your heart is hidin'
I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fightin'

Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me

What if when I'm long gone, it dawns on you
You just might want me back
Let me make myself clear, if I leave here
It's done; I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
Well I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it

Baby I love you, don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time, for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
Don't make me 

Baby I'm beggin' please
And I'm down here on my knees
I... don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me


Don't make me
Stop lovin' you

Stop needin' you

Where are you now?
Who's holding you now?
When your world stands still, do you remember?
Leave were falling
We were falling
Almost like a dream, do you remember?
Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holding forever back then
Do you remember?

Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away, but always with me
And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when


We ran, we kissed, we learned to love, to live

We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holding forever back then
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

Hey, baby I just asked your daddy
If I could take your hand
He said, "Boy, over my dead body"
Guess I arent his kind of man
But I love you and you love me
So, baby I got to plan
We'll push my truck off of Red Top Bridge
Right below the Jackson Dam

Hey, they'll be dragging the river
Catching nothing but an old catfish
They'll be dragging the river
That'll show that son of a bitch

It's been raining for the last two weeks
So the water's up good and high
We'll just wait 'til it's good n' late
So there arent nobody passing by
I'll call my cousin
He'll pick us up an' take us to the Greyhound Bus
We'll be standing in front of that preacher
By the time they're looking for us

And they'll be dragging the river
But they arent going to find a thing
They'll be dragging the river
I'll be wearing me a diamond ring
Ah, we're going to show them

I know that it might sound crazy
Just a little bit too extreme
But to get some of your sweet loving
Baby, I'd do anything
Sooner or later
They'll find my letter saying that we're alright
We'll be rocking at the Red Roof Inn
This time tomorrow night

And they'll be dragging the river
Saying, "Lord, what a crying' shame"
They'll be dragging the river
We'll be running', they'll never see it coming

They'll be dragging the river
They'll be dragging the river
But they arent going to find a thing
Sorry about calling your dad a son of a bitch earlier
Hey, do you think he'll still hire me?
Whoa, that thing's little
The diamond, I mean

Hey girl, hey where you going?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be heading home so early now
You say you got to work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl I think you and I should just

Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's getting low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go

We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

This place is closing down
But I don't want to quit
Got to good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is

And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doing something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

Might make a memory that we won't forget

So let's just drink on it
Yeah
Mm
Drink on it
Sleep on it
We can just drink on it

Wrong side of town on the second floor
Couple blocks down from the liquor store
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch
...or not
I can call a car it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone

So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that youve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time

Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that youve been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you

So baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine

But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together

So baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine
But every goodbye

There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you

Theres something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me

Every time I hear that song
Im standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you
Yeah, I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody

It brings back an old feeling
Running into you like this
I'm really not afraid of hurting
But I can't stand the awkwardness
Do I laugh
Do I cry
Do I dare look in your eyes

Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's going to show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you

You seem to be a bit distracted
I wish that I could feel the same
You never were too good at acting
Baby some things never change
I can't keep from letting go
It's something that I can't control


You stand there looking sweet and innocent
But how can you be so cruel and confident
At my expense


Oh yeah, every time I look at you

Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Yeah
Ooh-oh-oh
O-oh-oh
O-oh-oh

I've been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Oh, tell me what I got
I get this feeling
Times just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I got to cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Deep way down in your heart
You're burning yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life arent passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You'll get by if you'd only

Cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
O-wee Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose

Ooh-oh-oh

Ooh-oh-oh

Ooh-oh-oh

Ooh

We've got to turn you around
And put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
I'm turning it loose

Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut loose
 footloose

Kick off the Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut

 everybody cut loose

There's a picture of you on my dresser
And it's been there since you said goodbye
And when I look in its direction
You're strain my heart straight in the eye

It just sits there smiling at me
Taking me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

I wish I could tear it to pieces
And I've tried with all of my might
But somehow I can't find courage
Oh, to let you out of my sight


Yea before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

There's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh, but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'da never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightening
Threw some punches then we had a laugh

Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends

Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?

Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust where ever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends

Yeah, here we go
Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high and I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh, woah, woah-oh

Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends

I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah

Mason jars on the dresser
Filled with quarters and dollars saving them for our trip around the world
But now you've changed your tune
There'll be no honeymoon
So I'm going there without you girl

I'm going down to Mexico in a glass of tequila
Going down to Purto Rico in a bottle of rum
Going to Honolulu in a mai tai mug
Then I'm coming back home to
Georgia in a jug

We'll never ride that bus to Mexico City
It's a pity we'll never sail our ship into Waikiki and
We'll never share that brick suburban home
Today I'm taking that money out of the jar
Tonight I'll buy my ticket down at the corner bar


You get up
You get coffee
You get paid
You get off
You get gas
You get beer
You get drunk
You get weird
You get drove home
You get up thrown
You get hungry
You get chicken
Your guitar needs picking
You get tan
You get pale
You get sick
You get well
You get dressed up
You get messed up

Everybody say, God Almighty it's Friday
Everybody get sideways to have a little fun
Everybody's living
Everybody's trying
Everybody's dying
To get some

You get lost
You get saved
You get waxed
You get shaved
You get high, real high
Forget your next line
You get drive-thru, dollar menu



You get the girl
You get the one
You get her home
You get her done
You get hitched
You get mad
She gets a lawyer
She gets half
You get banged up
You got to raise up
That red Dixie cup

And everybody say, God Almighty it's Friday
Everybody get sideways to have a little fun
Everybody's living
Everybody's trying
Everybody's dying to get some
Everybody's dying to get some
Dying to get some

The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

Oh no, here I go

Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

I'd never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?

Oh no, here I go

Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?

There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart

Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Oh, go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Arent who I want to be
But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

There's more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you
He gave me you

I'm gonna take you for a date
Take you for a ride
Gonna get you over there on the passenger's side
I'm gonna put the radio on your favorite song
I'm gonna crank it on up and get you singing along

Hey, hey

Shes got her new jeans on
Looking so right its wrong
Ummm everybody stares as she walks on by
See those double takes
Hear those slamming breaks
Yeah when she smiles you can see the sparks fly

My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walking beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at starting fires
But Im the only one
Arent no doubt
Only one that puts them out

Shes got her long red dress
And boy I must confess
Ummm when you see her she'll take your breath away
When we're out on the town
Eyes look her up and down
Yeah she makes the night time hotter than a summer day

My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walking beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at starting fires
But Im the only one
Arent no doubt

My baby's gotten good
Good at starting fires
Hearts burn for her
But I know Im walking beside her
Yeah maybe babys gotten good at starting fires
But Im the only one
Arent no doubt
Only one that puts them out

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

Goodbye, Baby
Shotgun in my daddy's truck
Eight years old and acting tough
He smiled at me and said, "You shift the gears"
He would search that FM dial
And I would count down every mile
Til the station out of Tulsa came in clear
It was old Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul
I'm talking bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song
While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vernon Alabama
I was learning bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing
I'm talking bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song
Yeah, it makes me think of days long gone
Miss my dad and call my mom
Run, laugh, and pray, and drink til dawn
When I hear a good country
A good old country, a good country song

Baby baby baby
He's got you crying again
Baby baby baby
He's got you crying again
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
He kicks off his shoes throws down this coat
Opens a beer grabs the remote
Youre never heard youre seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen

Baby baby baby
Why don't you just get rid of him 
He's a Good Old Boy but he's a Bad Old Boyfriend 

He makes you cry I'll make you laugh
He rubs you wrong I'll rub your back
Youre never heard youre seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby baby baby

Why don't you just get rid of him 
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
Good old boy bad old boyfriend

Well every time I turn around
I see some dude dressed like a clown
Baggy pants and a cap on sideways
They don't say ma'am or sir no more
They won't even hold a door for a woman
Well it's a crying shame

Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be working on a farm
Or out there chasing rainbows
Are they back in Oklahoma
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go

Are they sitting on an old bar stool
Telling lies and cutting the fool
Talking about the way it was and wishing
Or down in Orange Beach, Alabama
Hanging out at the Flora-Bama
Headed out the pass and going fishing

Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be working on a farm
Or out there chasing' rainbows
Are they hiding down in Georgia
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go

Are they driven cattle and riding high
Living life the cowboy way
Or down there on the front line
Fighting off the bad guys
Given them hell for the good ole USA

Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be working on a farm
Or out there chasing rainbows
Are they back in Oklahoma
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Yeah just where the hell did the good ole boys go

I know where a few of them are
Down there in southern Oklahoma
There's even some down in Texas
I even saw one in New York one time
You know what I'm talking about ladies
Hell, I'll hold the door for you
I'll hold your purse for you
And I'll even go pick up some feminine products for you
That's what a good ole boy will do

Time by lady Rolex
Body by Bow flex
Hair by Hollywood salon
Bag by Louis Vuitton
High heels, Manolo Blahniks
Tanqueray gin and tonics
Sunglass by Gucci
Never been to Chatter, hoochie

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A
But when it comes to loving me, she arent that way
She got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country in her

Friday, Soho
That's where all the cool, cool people go
Shake your pelvis
That's how you get behind the velvet
Disco at the Air Bar
But what I really miss is a guitar
With a whammy bar
Going wah, wah, wah, wah

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A
But when it comes to loving me, she arent that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her

Ah, hang on!

She's got a little country, got a little country
I said, she's got a little country, got a little country in her
Got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country
Giddy up!

She's running with the big dogs, she's living on the high hog
We're rolling in the hay every night
She's even saying yeehaw riding that hillbilly seesaw
We're having us a ball and holding on tight

She may look like New York, Miami, L.A
But when it comes to loving me, she arent that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her

If my heart was just a destination
She had herself one hell of a vacation
If my kiss was just the main attraction
She wore it out like it was going out of fashion
If my touch was just some kind of ride
Then she loved that roller-coaster
I guess she came down from that high
When it was over it was over

She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made us some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't coming back
Whoa-oh oh-oh
That's the last I see of her
Whoa-oh oh-oh
She's been there
Got the T-shirt

I wonder if she'll just throw it in the closet
Or keep it out and tell her friends just how she got it
I wonder if she's sleeping in or dreaming in it
I wonder if she knows what she did to me, yeah

She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made us some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't coming back
Whoa-oh oh-oh
That's the last I see of her
Whoa-oh oh-oh
She's been there
Got the T-shirt

 on the front
 on the back
Took it when she left
Took a lot more than that
Whoa-oh oh-oh

She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made us some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't coming back
Whoa-oh oh-oh
That's the last I see of her
Whoa-oh oh-oh
She's been there
Got the T-shirt

It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure arent for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun
He bought it new out of a Sears & Roebuck catalog
And it shot a many shell over the top of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun

It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun

He handed it to me on the day I turned 13
With a half-shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
With granddaddy's gun


There's a long beard living on the living room wall
That I got with a box call
And granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on 49
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
Granddaddy's gun

It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure arent for sale

Lookout!
People used to call me backwards
Living out here with the tractors
Letting this world leave me behind
Now-a-days I'm an innovator
I'm a country boy prognosticator
I'm a man ahead of my times

I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of corn, peas and beans
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing

Sheets on the clothes line drying
Red Tail hawks a flying
A couple of deer on the timber line
And I know a lot more about cane pole fishing
Then I ever will know about carbon emission
And my little corner of the world is doing just fine

Yeah, I've got a hundred acre farm
I've got a john deere in my barn
I've got a garden in my yard, full of root baked potatoes and greens
I've got a guitar I play unplugged
I've got a home-grown girl I love
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing
I was green before green was a thing

Oh yeah

I got some Friday jingle jangle in my pocket
Whatcha say we slip away, rock a few night moves
Spend the evening in some cozy conversations
Bartender shaking up a
Having us some good time groove
And we'll keep the party going
When they close it down at two

Me and you are hangover due
I'm just sayin'
Wanna wake up girl with our heads a little bangin'
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Only seeing only my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due

Lemme order you another Pinkatini number
Pretty soon or later you'll be bumming a cigarette
Gettin' my whiskey mixing with you tipsy little hot mess
Black dress kisses
Guess what happens next
Yeah a night we can't remember
I'm never gonna forget

Me and you are hangover due
I'm just sayin'
Wanna wake up with our heads a little bangin'
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Seeing only my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due


Me and you are hangover due
I'm just sayin'
Wanna wake up with our heads a little bangin'
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Only seeing my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due
Hangover due

Yeah!

I hit the ground running with the morning sun
When a job needs doing, I get it done
I show up early and I go home late
Everybody knows I pull my weight

'Cause I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting

Well, baby, I hurt, he done me wrong
The going got tough and got gone
Well, he arent here and I arent him
And even if the walls come fallen in

You know I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting
Yeah

Baby, when your heart is aching
Lean on me, my back arent breaking
All I'm saying is

I don't mind doing
A little heavy lifting
I'm always giving
My everything
Even when I'm hurting
I keep on working
And as long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting

Honey, I arent quitting
I'm always giving
My everything

Yeah

As long as I'm still alive and kicking
I'll be sticking to the heavy lifting
Yeah

You were just some one
Some friend of mine said take her out
An' have yourselves a good time
To be honest I was far from over a broken heart
You were the furthest thing from my mind
And it didnt seem to matter to you
When I looked away when we were introduced

Cause you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
And I slowly started coming around
Now here I am

To tell the truth I did my best to tell myself
Hey dont forget the last time
And I stood there in disbelief
That how easily you got to me with your eyes
You reached across the table and you took my hand
I knew I was in trouble right there and then


Down on one knee
Am I getting to you baby?
The way you got to me


Hey, hey, I'm out here bailing hay
And all my friends are cruising 'round town
Checking' out the pretty girls
Hey! And what do they say
They say hey, hey
Park that Deere, come out and play
Kick that tire, wipe my perspire
Because my whole life is hay

Growing like weeds, stick out your teeth
Playing underneath the baby Jesus
Blowing out the truck, heading down the highway
Looking pretty soft up in the loft
Come on baby kick your cowgirls off
I'm picking you up after I draw my pay
And we'll be Rolling in the hay

Hey, hey, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet
Different strokes for different folks
A little fella walks up in a pink beret
He says "Hey" - Hey, hell that's OK
Turn the guitars up and raise them cups
Hell my whole life is hay


Put it on a flatbed and go for a ride
Under the moonlight, you by my side
Give it to the cow, make it go moo
Koo-koo-kachoo, kick it off your shoe
Break a camel's back, jack
Then you put it in a stack yeah


My whole life is hay
Rolling in the hay
Hey!
Now come here, hey, hey
Hey!

Oh man, you've got to watch where you're stepping around here
Yeah I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Connway Twitty
Don't know nothing about grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonking and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud

We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Arent nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

Nah, you arent got to be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You arent alone
You arent alone


Come on y'all

We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Arent nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly bone ba-bone ba-bone bone
I've always wanted to sing the bone song

One day shy of 8 years old, grandma passed away
I was a broken hearted little boy, blowing out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go, with a cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said don't be sad child, grandma's watching you today

'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven and her tears are pouring down
That's how you know she's watching, wishing she could be here now
And sometimes if your lonely, just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watching over you and me

Season's come and seasons go, nothing stays the same
I grew up, fell in love, met a girl who took my name
Year by Year, made a life in this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together, lord I sure do miss her now!


But there's holes in the floor of heaven, and her tears are pouring down
That's how I know she's watching, wishing she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely, I remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watching over you and me
Well my little girl is 23, I walk her down the aisle
Its a shame her mom can't be here now, to see her lovely smile
They throw the rice, I catch her eye
As the rain starts coming down

She takes my hand says daddy don't be sad, 'cause I know Momma is watching now
And there's holes in the floor of heaven, and her tears are pouring down
Thats how you know she's watching, wishing she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely, I remember she can see
Yes, there's holes in the floor of heaven, and she's watching over you and me

Watching over you and me
Watching over you and me
Watching over you and me

Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

Another airplane, another sunny place I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home

Another Christmas day
Will come and go away
But I got so far to go
But I want to go home
I need to go home

Maybe surrounded by
Strangers and Christmas lights
I shouldn't feel so alone
But I want to go home
God I miss you, you know
I can close my eyes and see the angel on the tree
A blanket of snow outside
And all my friends and family
And though I know that you're no farther than a call away
I need to see your face
A call could never be the same


Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
And I want to go home

Now the reasons I'm so far away arent good enough
Whatever they need me for
I know that I need you more
So I'll do the things I got to do to get back to you
I need you to believe
I'll make it back by Christmas Eve

Another Christmas day will come and go away
And I wont leave you alone
No I'm going to go home
I'm going to be home
Though I'm surrounded by
This cold December night
I feel so alone
I'm going to go home
Babe, I miss you you know

Let me go home
I've had my run baby I'm done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright
When I'm holding you tight
Cause this Christmas I'm home

I look out across corn rows from a dirt road
Babies kicked back in the front seat
Got her bare fit hanging out the window
We take a trip down memory lane
Dirt on the truck, no chance of rain
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way
And if it don't show up, we'll be alright
Because folks round here wouldn't take a million
For a different life

Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on Sundays
I won't ever get too far away
From Home sweet home...

Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face
Knowing that this place is blessed
By God's amazing grace

Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on Sundays
I won't ever get too far away
From Home sweet home...

No matter I go
Or where the road might leave
This little speck on the map, will always be

Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I won't ever get too far away
From Home sweet home...

Yeah, I'm coming home

Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I arent done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each others arms
I could have said "I love you"
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart



I'll be your honey bee
This morning when I woke up*
And man I had a bad backache
And my head felt like it took new form
Last night I stuck an ice pack where I sat on the maniac
2000 pounds of muscle and horn
I remember smilin' as we kicked up mud
Out in the bright lights and I recall
A cussin when I lost control
And he sent me on a high flight
Hey, I don't do this for the money
I don't do it for the fame
It's cause he threw me to the ground all bloody
That's the reason I can't walk away
I stumbled out to my pick-up
My joints popped in ten different places
One I never knew I had
I'm out here on the highway
My one track mind sticks in replay
And I start to get real mad
Seems I've lost track of all the buckles and the big checks
But I remember every time I've landed in a pile of B.S
Hey, I don't do this for the money
I don't do it for the fame
It's cause he threw me to the ground all bloody
That's the reason I can't walk away
Hey, I don't do this for the money
I don't do it for the fame
It's cause he threw me to the ground all bloody
That's the reason I can't walk away
I can't walk away
I can't walk away
I can't walk away

There she was... laughin', talkin', window shopping with a new guy
And I'd heard about him... I heard she found him right around when we said good-bye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered

I don't care, she don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care

Almost 10:00... I should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in... knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh, but I just kept on drivin' back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way, when...

I don't care, she don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care

When I got home the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left, and I miss you. Give me a ring"

I still care, she's all that matters
I still love her just like always, gotta have her
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care
I don't care

He'd get home at five-thirty
Fix a drink and sit down in his chair
Pick a fight with momma
Complain about the kids getting in his hair
At night he'd sit alone and smoke
I'd see his frown behind the lighters flame
Now that same frowns in my mirror
I got my daddy's blood inside my veins

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddys' yell, mommas cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink

Chicken TV dinner
Six minutes on defrost three on high
Beer to wash it down then another
Some whiskey on the side
It's not so bad alone here
It don't bother me that every nights the same
I don't need another lover hanging around
Trying to make me change

Fish swim, birds fly
Lovers leave, by and by
Old men sit and think
I Drink

I know, what I am
But I don't, give a damn

Fish swim, birds fly
Daddys yell, mommas cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink

I Drink

If I was a cloud, I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun, I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon, I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star, charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star

If I was your man, the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man, we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man

If I was a song, I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream, I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream

If I was your man, we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby

If I-I-I-I-I was your man

You would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man

And if we were love, we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love

If I was your man, sweet loving man
If I was your man
If I was your man

I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
Still she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you

You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
Well I wasn't surprised
Still it hit me kind of hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone I've done some praying
Some searching for myself


You'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

I found someone
Just happened outta the blue
It took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun

Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone

You told me I'd regret it
On the day I left you
I had the nerve to laugh
As I walked away
Well, its been six months
And eighteen days
Feeling nothing but this empty pain
And I just had to tell you
Even if there's nothing
Left to say

I felt the burning on the hurting side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longing on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I was going to show you
That I didn't need you
Now I need to show you I was wrong
Here I am knees to the floor
I don't want to live like this no more
I'm heartbeat in misery
Now all my pride is gone

I felt the burning on the hurting side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longing on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand where
Them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them old Duke boys, they're flattening their heels
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawnmower around
I'd go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams



If only in my dreams

I can taste your kiss on my lips
And I'm wrapped around your finger tips
As I watch the moonlight dancing on your skin
Your green eyes and the sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again

I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until youre gone

Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why

I'm falling for you even though I know your only playing with my heart
Tomorrow might be hell
But a night or two of loving you is better than never at all
And I can't help myself
So I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until youre gone
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Till youre gone

I look down and my cell phone rings
And I see your name and I know what that means
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till your gone
Every time you need to take it home?
Seeing you there just breaks my heart?
I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till youre gone
Your green eyes and that sweet red wine
Go to my head girl every time
But I don't care
I'll just hold on
Till youre gone

Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messin' around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talkin' you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'mma go on and take a swing

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still lovin' on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, laying next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

You find the spot and I'll find the money
You be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you hang the stars
You pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs

You say you don't know what you were thinking
Well neither do I
And after the time we spent together
You think you deserve another try
Well girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye

And say you're sorry
Oh, you're sorry
You want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just arent good enough

You say you never meant to hurt me
Well that might be true
But do you really think I should forgive you
For what you put me through
Oh, I remember every time you said you loved me
But I know now your love was just a lie


Oh, girl I don't know what it is
That you're expecting
Just because you looked me in the eye
And say you're sorry

Oh, you're sorry
So sorry
And you want it back the way it was
Well I'm sorry
But sometimes sorry
Just arent good enough
I don't need another drink of Johnny Walker Red
And I don't need another drag off a Marlboro cigarette
And I don't need me telling myself everything's gonna be alright
And I don't need me lying here alone again tonight
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I don't need those buddies of mine taking me on the town
Or a TV preacher warning me bout the road I'm going down
I don't need to let 'I'm sorry' not roll off my lips
And I don't need to let my pride talk me out of this
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
Like I never needed anything before
Like my life depends on you walking through that door
I need you, girl
Oh, I need you, girl
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
I just need my girl

In my heaven there arent no lawyers
Don't need names on dotted lines
Folks do business like they ought to
A good firm handshake works just fine
We feed lawyers to the lions
In my heaven there arent no children
Toting' loaded guns to school
Arent no such thing as peer pressure
Being who you are is cool
They still teach that golden rule

In my heaven we hurt no one
No lying, crying, or dying young
No one's lonely, no one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven

In my heaven I can sing like Elvis
Play guitar like B. B. King
Slide a fastball past Hank Aaron
Batter, batter, batter swing
I can do most anything


I know that it's God's decision
What my heaven's going to be
And I arent telling him his business
But if he left it up to me

Then in my heaven
There's football with no referees
In my heaven
There's never been an injury
In my heaven
Angels yodel when they sing
In my heaven
The fish will bite most anything
In my heaven
In my heaven
In my heaven

Well it must've been 100 in that summer sun
And I've been in it all day
Putting up with that prick of an owner's son
Making me some hillbilly pay
Working right through lunch, busting my hump
Helping his daddy stay rich
So when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
I told that little son of a bitch

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me son
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Arent a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Yea I've been dragging home almost every night
'Bout the time that you're going out
Wearing something way too short and tight
Leaving me and the dog on a couch
Yea, now word's getting round you've been sneaking downtown
Dancing way too risky
Well I got a few dirty dance moves too
And a cute little one finger wave



Here it comes



Oh yea
Woo!
Yes I do
Look at that thing
You know you're number one, baby

Easy, easy, easy, easy
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
Easy, easy, easy...

Yeah I used to be alright just saying goodnight
Maybe see you tomorrow
Yeah I could go a couple of days
Just doing my thing
Whatever I wanted
But now, your kisses hit me like lightning
Cant fight it, girl you put it on me
Yeah you stone me, when you aint with me
I aint nothing but lonely

It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me
It ain't easy anymore
No it ain't easy, that's for sure

Something different 'bout a Friday night
And the neon lights if you ain't beside me
Now I love it when you call me on the phone
Saying "hurry on home" you got something special on
And it's just for me
Damn you make it hard to leave

It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me

It ain't easy leaving my baby in the bed
And driving away knowing the last thing you said
Was "don't go, don't leave, lay here with me"
Girl you're making me crazy
It ain't easy, no, no, no, it ain't easy
It sure ain't baby, yeah baby

It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No i ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl believe me
It ain't easy anymore

No it ain't easy, walking out your door
Mmm, no it ain't easy, no, no
No it ain't easy walking out your door
It ain't easy, oh, it ain't easy

There ought to be a town somewhere
Named for how I feel
Yeah I could be the mayor down there
And say welcome to SorryVille
It wouldn't be on a map nowhere
You might say that it doesn't exist
But if you make enough wrong turns
It'd be hard to miss
There ought to be a bridge somewhere
They could dedicate to me
I'd probably come through the ceremony
With a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side
And there I'd light a match
And sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
Wondering how I'm going to get back

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and I curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back
But I don't say nothing' as I watch you pack
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy being' me

Ought to be a side show act for freaks like me
Yeah I could be the star of the show
With my name on the marquee
In a room with a big red button that says "Danger: Do Not Touch"
And twice a day I'd mash it down
And you could watch me self-destruct

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and I curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back
But I don't say nothing' as I watch you pack
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy being' me
It ain't easy being me

I knew something was the matter
It really needed my attention
And I had planned to look into it someday
But I was busy making money
I wanted you to be proud of me
Now I wish I could turn the clock back some way

I thought there was time

I never thought that you would leave me
I always thought that I could find you
Somewhere near a phone to answer when I call
Now you have my full attention
Now you're all that I can think of
This is not what I expected at all

I thought there was time
I thought there was time

Are you even on this planet
Can you see these pretty flowers
Or am I standing here just talking to the wind
How I wish that I had told you
How I wish that I had shouted
I love you I love you I love you I love you back then

I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock


Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell
Thats the jingle bell rock
Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song

There's a seven-forty-seven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whiskey power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home
Cause we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Yeah, don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Oh, yeah, we're just getting started
I never liked the taste of whiskey til I kissed it off of her lips
Never knew just what was hitting me, getting me tipsy
But there I sit, Levi's on a dogwood branch
Yeah, she was taking me under
I might have lost my innocence
But she was saving my soul that summer
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
She might have been a falling angel
Nah, I didn't care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered, sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
That's the way I could spend forever
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
Oh yeah, just south of heaven
Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine
Yeah, that'd be mine
Oh, just a little bit south of heaven

Tearing down a dirt road
Rebel flag flying
Coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer
And a cold one in my lap
Earnhardt sticker behind my head
And my woman by my side
Tail-pipe's popping
The radio's rocking "Country Boy Can Survive"
If you got a problem with that, ha ha!
You can kiss my country ass
Well, I love Turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans
Smoke nothing but Marlboro reds
Tattoos up & down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
My Granddaddy fought in World War Two
My Daddy went to Vietnam
And I arent scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
You can kiss my country ass

If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you arent down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass. Aw yeah!

Aw yeah

Well, there's a whole lot of high-class people out there
That's looking down on me
Cause the country club where I belong
Is the Honky Tonk till three in the morning
Don't wear no fancy clothes
No ties or three piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage cap
My t-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass

If you're a down home, backwoods redneck
Hey, come on, stand up and raise your glass
But if you arent down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass

Well I'm a front-porch sitting
Guitar picking, moonshine sipping
Backer juice spitting country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken & blue gill fishing
And outlaw women, an' I wouldn't change if I could. NO!
I arent trying to start no fight, but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
Stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
You can kiss my country ass
I said if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born, Redneck to the bone
Ever-loving country ass

Think I'll grab a bottle of Patron
When I get off work on my way home
Fill that hot tub full of bubble bath, kick back, relax
Baby you and me and nothing on yea
Got a weekend coming just in time
We're both needing what I've got in mind
What I got in mind, that's me and you into me and you
Can't wait to get you all alone yea

Lay low, stay home and stay high
Stay up, make love, all night
I want to run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low

We'll let our kisses do the talking girl
Take each other to another world
Feel like we're a million miles from here
Somewhere out there, without going anywhere at all

Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I want to run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and

Lay low, stay home and stay high, yea
Stay up, make love, all night
I want to run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow
Stay home, stay high and lay low

Stay home, stay high and lay low

Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

Na, na, na, na
C'mon
Na, na, na, na


The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

I never thought youd pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight

We don't have to be lonely tonight

I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

We don't have to be lonely tonight

We don't have to be lonely tonight

I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

I can be there in five
One more one last time

We don't have to be lonely tonight

We don't have to be lonely tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, yeah

Little by little, now babe
I've come a long, long way
Picking up the pieces
That you threw away
Did you give it up
Did I let you down
Either way, it doesn't matter
Cause I'm finally coming around
I hope you find where you belong
Hello - goodbye
Life goes on

In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I arent no fool
I know what she's thinking'
I can hold her in my arms
But, I could never let her stay
Cause, love
Your sweet love
Still gets in the way

Minute by minute
I hear the voice in my heart
And make a new start
So, I think a little less
I drink a little more
Cause, all in all she's everything
That I've been waiting for
She smiles that smile
I face the fact
Love's a give and take thing
And I can't give it back



What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

Mine would be... you

Ridin' rubber, rent checks, livin' on ramen
Chappin' our ass 'cause we can't afford Charmin
Rockin' that one-ply, one-ply
Shakin' down the couch, found a buffalo nickel
Medium guitar pick, Burger King pickle
Eww, it's kinda petrified, petrified

Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Doors unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Haw, baby doll, that's alright

Hey, girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Gettin' me feelin' filthy rich
Hey, girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey, that's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

Girl, I sure can't tell you've been workin' your butt off
The way you're rockin' them second-hand cutoffs
Mmm, can I talk you into takin' 'em off?
Score a little discount, 6-pack Keystone
Use a paper sack, twist a little home grown
Go on and get a Friday night on
Girl, one of these days, gonna look back laughin'
Sippin' pomegranate sake at Nobu
But, baby, 'til then I'm a have-not havin'
And everything I have's got, with you

Hey, girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Gettin' me feelin' filthy rich
Hey, girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey, that's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money

Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Doors unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Haw, baby doll, that's alright

Hey, girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Gettin' me feelin' filthy rich
Hey, girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey, that's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money


Those high heels with that sun dress
Turquoise heart hanging 'round your neck
Red lips like wine, want to drink them up
And keep on drinking' 'til you make me drunk
Tied up hair, want to let it down
And just let the rest fall to the ground
You take beautiful to the max
Can't help myself when you look like that

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

There's a million stars dancing in the sky
A picture perfect moon so bright
But I don't care, I'm looking at you
From where I stand you can beat the view

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

My eyes have seen
Some amazing things
But girl, my eyes arent seen
Nothing quite like you, hey baby

Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you
Come a little closer, come a little closer
Come a little closer, girl the way you look tonight
My eyes are the only thing I don't want to take off of you

Grandpa's down
By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes
From the back
Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line
While sipping on
Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us
My Dad's got
A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam
But he's still down
At the sawmill every day
Oh and first thing
'Fore the break of dawn
Mama's got his eggs
And coffee on
My whole life
It's been that way

We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung them around
My neck of the woods

Just as sure as the river flows
We take care of our own
Step right up when someone needs a friend
Last year on the Johnson farm
A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build them back again, all right



Ever since you left me
I've been ridin' 'round, cranking up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears
I don't know how much more missin' you I can take

I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I take a shot of I don't care what you're doing now
Chase that one with a cold screw you
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of someone new

That blond blonde blonde
At the bar, bar, bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart, heart, heart

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

When we were together
I thought life would suck forever
Even though I knew better than the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn
Gets kissed by the day break, got down on my knees

And I prayed, prayed, prayed
For a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

Now listen to me, this here is how it used to be

I can see the day that I wont want to hang out with the boys all night
Yeah and I can see a day when I'll walk off this dead end job for good
And I can see a day when I wont be afraid of getting older
But no matter what I do
Honey I cant see me never loving you

Some things are bound to change
But some things stay the same like they ought to
Some things are meant to be
Just like you and me together
If I die today or if I find a way to live forever
No matter what I do
Darling I cant see me never loving you

Yeah and I can see a time when you wont think you look as good as you used to
Oh and I can see a time your auburn hair will turn to gray
And I can see a time when you think that you wont blow my mind but I can tell you
No matter what I do
Darling I cant see me never loving you


No matter what I do
Honey I cant see me never loving you

Don't waste your time looking over your shoulder
Those loves from the past arent getting no closer
When I look in my future you're all I can see
Don't go loving on nobody but me

Nobody but me going to love you like you ought to be loved on
Nobody but me going to cry if you up and leave
You can do what you want to
But I'm asking pretty please  dont go loving on nobody but me

I took my time to tell you how I feel
Just because I took so long don't mean that it isn't real
I ain't got no diamond, but I'm down on my knees
Don't go loving on nobody but me


Don't go loving on nobody but me
Let's have an oh oh oh-oh-Oklahoma Christmas

Oh, even if we have to have it here in Tennessee, yeah

Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol Red
Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Arent nobody got past Red

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itching to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red will have you tired before the morning comes

Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait


Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard them let Red out
Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south


Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out

On a good day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm going to be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not having on a good day

So set them up
Here's a hundred dollars keep them coming Joe 
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not having' on a good day

On a good day, I would never crash a party
Knowing she'd be there with someone else
And On a good day, I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
On a good day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not having on a good day

Yeah I only see you Joe
When I'm not having a good day
No Im not having a good day

Sunrise
Slipping through the trees and it looks so pretty in your eyes
I guess I got carried away, kept you out here all night
I hope you dont mind
By the smile I see on your face, I think youre havin a good time, a good time

When I picked you up
Knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then
Soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around
All over the town
Whatever you like girl
Ain't a way I can love you
The way that I want to
In just one night girl

I know
That I'm just now getting to be somebody that you know
Kick your seat on back cause girl we're gonna take it real slow
We already turned last night into tomorrow
And we're just getting started

When I picked you up
Knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then
Soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around
All over the town
Whatever you like girl
Ain't a way I can love you
The way that I want to
In just one night girl

I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna do you right girl
You ain't a one kiss
Kind that I won't miss
You ain't just a one night girl

When I picked you up
Knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then
Soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around
All over the town
Whatever you like girl
Ain't a way I can love you
The way that I want to
In just one night girl

You ain't a one night girl
You ain't a one night girl
You ain't a one night girl
You ain't a one night girl
No, no


If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh

If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't want to fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one


If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears

This is a song
About best friends

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me
The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixing
Fire and gasoline


Hey Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hanging
From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two plane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas
Learned to drink Sangria
Till the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo
Ah but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came running down the hall
Wearing nothing
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero



And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the border guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash
He said
Dion a little funny business
In Mexico Amigo
But all I could think about
Was saving my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well it was your idea genius
I was just laying there in bed
When you said


Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates

Fires are burning up the forests
Down along the Amazon
There's children starving in Guatemala
They're just barely hanging on

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And Lord while you're listening
Could I mention some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

A teenage boy in Mississippi
Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for Mama to use


My wife is crying; Our baby's fighting
A battle that she may not win
The doctor's doing all that he can
God now it's all in your hands

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong

Now I'm just one man, a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem right here at home
I've got a problem right here at home

Girl I've been at work all week
Fingers to the bone I need
A little hit of you and me
A little time alone
All day I've been thinking about
Quitting early skipping out
Holing ass to hit the couch
And hang with you at home

We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We going to burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We got to whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Let other fools go paint the town
We'll just hold this sofa down
Till Monday morning rolls around
I'll tell you what let's do
You go grab those tater chips
I'll whip up some party dip
And well kick back and take a trip
Sip a beer or two


Yeah we got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We going to burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We got to whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby I don't know about you but I'm ready to roll

Yeah I'm ready to roll
Ready to roll
Redneck girl likes to cruise in daddy's pickup truck
And a redneck girl plays hard when she's down on her luck
Living for Friday afternoon
She's gonna show one ol' boy that weekend moon
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
A redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
She makes sweet rock and roll while she listens to the country songs
She's waiting for that moment of surrender
Her hands are callused but her heart is tender
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
Redneck girl got her name on the back of her belt
She's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
The Coyote is howling out on the prairie
First comes love, then comes marriage!
And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
You've got to gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl

On the Oklahoma shore of that old red river
I stand right here and curse my pride
That river runs deep
That current is strong
And the woman I love is on the other side
How did the love we made together
Break apart and drift away
Leave me lost and lonely
On this crimson bank

Red River Blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire if that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texoma sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm red river blue

They say everything is bigger
Under that Texas moon
I'll bet my right hand you won't find a bigger fool
She's probably smiling somewhere tonight
In someone else's arms
I'm here dragging the muddy bottom
For pieces of my heart

Red River Blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire if that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texoma sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm red river blue
She said goodbye and now I'm red river blue

Now I love country music
And I guess I always will
But these days, when I turn on the radio
It's just not the same thrill
I like a song that gives me chill bumps
Now and then there's some that still do
But I'm fed up with the same old vanilla
Hey how about you
I'm tired of the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Hey there Mr. Songwriter
Come and visit in my home
Then tell me about life being perfect
And love that goes on and on and on
Then ride with me in my old Bronco
Down to the factory for eight hours
Then let me introduce you to my supervisor
Then write me a song about sunshine and flowers

And the same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb

I want to hear a song about passion
I want to hear a song about sin
I want to hear a song about redemption
Yeah, sing me one of them
Tell me about a cowboy in Australia
Tell me about a prisoner in China
Tell me about some old stock car driver
Down in Orangeburg, South Carolina
Instead of 

The same old guy
With the same old song
About the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb

Same old
Same old
Same old


You're crashin' into me like waves on the coast
Every time we talk, you move in close
I don't want you stop, I don't want you to stop tonight
We've got the last two glasses on a straw hut bar
Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Oh
Only thing I want to do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around

All Aboard
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas eve
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe
Oh the weather man was calling for the snow to keep coming down
And the way that it was falling, Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, Santas sleigh never made it to town

Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow 
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then coming around the mountain, right through the steam and smoke
Pulling; 16 coaches shouting ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train

Well now, he could barely hold it coming down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks
When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered around
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around


Oh yeah, no need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train!

I'm standing in my savior's shadow
He is watching over me
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder
As he cries for me
And standing in my savior's shadow
Grace will lead to where I'm free
I take his hand, we walk together
And his light shines on me

Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be

I'm standing in my savior's shadow
Following his footsteps there
Every mountain, every ocean
Here's my every prayer

Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be

Though the devil tried to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
When I'm in my savior's shadow
Who I'm supposed to be

He meets her at the front door, he can tell she's had a hard day at work
She's been needing him and he's sure been wanting her
He touches her with tenderness, takes her in his arms and takes it slow
What a shame she can't get that at home

What a shame she can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house
And love arent all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home

After the loving, they lie there and talk for a while
She loves how he listens and he sure loves to see her smile
He wants to keep her but he loves her enough to let her go
What a shame she can't get that at home


He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame she can't get that at home

On Friday night when I see her out
Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There arent a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is

She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a getting to me

She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move


I'm going to work my courage up
Tell her I'm in love
I'm in love a lot
She has my heart on a string
Like everything the girl has got


You know if I'd seen her coming
I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I thought she'd say to me

Well it was nothing like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

I felt like some neighbor
Just some guy she once knew
You'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hiding her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned and
Introduced me to her new friend John

I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I knew she'd say to me

I guess she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone ignored
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

I know it might sound crazy
But I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me

When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an F in
But now I understand perfectly

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover 
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah shes got a way
Shes got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words

Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover 
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah shes got a way
Shes got a way with words

Yeah she's got a way with words

She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S.O.B. in sober
She put the hang in hangover 
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F.U. in my future
Yeah shes got a way
Shes got a way with words

Yeah she's got a way with words


She's got a way with words
She's got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words

Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and maked her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that.. maybe I...

Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..

She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change
She was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'...
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes

Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I"ll..
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..

I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone..
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter, oh at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through...
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!
Christ, the Saviour is born
Christ, the Saviour is born
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Sleep in heavenly peace

Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be
Here is what Christmas time means to me
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear


Yea, Hollywood Boulevard
Looking down, seeing stars
90210, Rodeo is Rodeo
Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, and hang with my friends
With them red Maserati's and them tuned up bodies
And everybody going to be the next somebody
Yea, this place is a trip
Hey but meanwhile back in the sticks

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or keeping the buzz sipping on a little moonlight

Yea, they know how to rock
Out in the boondocks
Cause believe me I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
Yea, two lane town squares
Cotton queens, county fairs
With a water tank
Got 100 girls' names under the paint
Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, I miss my friends
With them pick them up trucks and them dirt road ruts
And all them country girls get to strutting their stuff
East, west, north or south
Yea you better believe that right about now

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or lighting it up with a KC spotlight

Yea, they all got the swerve
Down back in their hometown
I wish that I was there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere

Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
And twisting it up and dodging them blue lights

Yea, they know how to kick it
Way out past the limits
Cause baby I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
Yea, somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
I wish that I was there
Yea, I wish that I was there

Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot seioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
Youre not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere
On some beach, somewhere

If time has no end and if time has no end
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity
A circle an eternal loop
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth

Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday

Before we were babies
There's nothing we recall and when we go back
Will it fade to black and that's all
Or could we be destined for some other time and place
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased


Will we see Jesus coming as the sunshine fills the night
Or when we die will we fly into the light
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe
Someday we'll know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
Well it must've been 100 in that summer sun
And I've been in it all day
Putting up with that prick of an owner's son
Making me some hillbilly pay
Working right through lunch, busting my hump
Helping his daddy stay rich
So when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
I told that little son of a bitch
Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me son
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Hey I've been breaking my butt but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Yea I've been dragging home almost every night
'Bout the time that you're going out
Wearing something way too short and tight
Leaving me and the dog on a couch
Yea, now word's getting round you've been sneaking downtown
Dancing way too risky
Well I got a few dirty dance moves too
And a cute little one finger wave
Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Well I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Here it comes
Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Hey I've been busting my ass, you don't care about that
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Oh yea
Woo!
Yes I do
Look at that thing
You know you're number one, baby

Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake

You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing

You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer

Pain is growing like a vine stanglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating

When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still suffocating

The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from a storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating


Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
Cause nothings changed, nothings changed


When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
When Memphis arent got the blues
That's when I'll stop loving you
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

Baby, I don't mind you asking
If there's going to come a day
When I'll say goodbye
Maybe, I guess anything could happen
But it's as close to never
As you're ever going to find

When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
When there's no tequila in Mexico
That's when I'm going to let you go
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

Darling, some things won't ever change
My love is one of those things

When New York is a one horse town
That's when I won't need you 'round
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans


I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You dont have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You dont have to keep on smiling that smile thats driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You dont have to keep me fallin like this
But itd sure be cool if you did

You cant shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby Ill do whatever you wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs Daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake

But I'm ten times crazier without about your love, girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

Well I'm all about a weekend, kicking with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinking' that I won't leave them hanging
Cause even though I'm crazy about them good old boys

I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I know you love me girl that's easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me

I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

There's a house that's a little run down
This city arent never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up
Seven children raised on love
When life gets hard that's where we go

Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home

Daddy built it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road
I get that feeling in my soul
I thank God some things still remain


Once I get myself through that old screen door
The world can't touch me anymore


That's what I call home
That's what I call home

Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
An old dirt road
I want to see your bare feet on my dash
The night wind blowing your hair back
Slide across that seat
And sit real close
Baby, let's go

Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll kick them off before the night is through
And we'll be doing' that thing we do

We'll take some blankets and we'll make a spread
I'll tuck you into my pick-up bed
We'll watch the country stars
Putting on a show
I want to see your bare skin in the moonlight
Kiss your lips, girl, and hold you all night
Make a lot of love
And make it real slow
Baby, let's go

We'll shuck them off before the night is through
And we'll be doing that thing we do
We've been running 'round doing this and that
It's time we got back to what we're good at


We'll shuck them off before the night is through
And we'll be doing that thing we do
Yeah, we'll be doing that thing we do
Doing that thing we do
Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down


My brother said that I
Was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child
So I got by with more

I guess she was tired by
The time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried
I could do no wrong
She would always save me
Because I was her baby

I worked a factory in Ohio
A shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham
Turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy
I said "Your boy is now a man"
She said "I don't care if you're 80
Youll always be my baby"

She loved that photograph
Of our whole family
She'd always point us out
For all her friends to see

That's Greg he's doing great
He really loves his job
And Ronnie with his 2 kids
How about that wife he's got
And that one's kind of crazy
But that one is my baby

I got a call in Alabama
Said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
Cause your mamma really needs you
And says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80
So she could see her baby

She looked like she was sleeping
And my family had been weeping
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breaking
I never got to say goodbye

I softly kissed that lady
And cried just like a baby

Mr. Bourbon and Coke laughs
At all of my jokes when he's drinking
Mr. Martini stares and he
Never shares what he's thinking
Miss Sexy Red Wine tells me at closing time
That she'll phone me
Mr. Whiskey Shot Glass watches hookers
Walk past when he's lonely

I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender

Mr. Never Does Tip says
That none of his kids ever call home
Mrs. Chews On Her Lip tells someone
She's at work on her cell phone
Mrs. Husband Just Died always
Breaks down and cries on the weekends
Just another long night in a
Bartender's life with some good friends


And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're going
They leave a lot of good things behind
Guess you could call me a dreamer
And I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
And do all the things they tell me to
Yeah I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last
Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done


Oh yeah whisper baby

There a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane blacktop
Where all the folks come to hear country music play
And every year the city's getting closer, Lord knows it won't stop
And old Hank the bartender gave us the bad news today, yeah he said

This land was our land but Lord now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
Still we've sung the last country song

There's 300 acres of cotton corn and a little bit of gravel
All bought up by a builder from downtown
Tomorrow when the earth starts a-shaking and the walls start to rattle
A big bulldozer's going to take Hank's roadhouse down, so everybody sing


Will we play "Swinging'" or "He Stopped Loving Her Today"
It's really sad to see it end this way


Still we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song
Oh we've sung the last country song

He was sitting at the bar, sipping on a regular Coke
We were drinking and smoking and making him the butt of our jokes
We all said, "Man, what happened to you? Why can't you just have a few?"
He said, "I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't"

Because the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine
I get loud, I get proud and it gets worse
Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Now, there arent no in-between
'Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink

A couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot
Hell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start looking hot
And pretty soon I'm bumming cigarettes and sweet talking some big brunette
Yeah, once I get on a roll, there arent no telling where I'll stop

'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink
Yeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine
I get loud, I get proud and it gets worse
Well if I have one, I'll have thirteen
Now, there arent no in-between
Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink

Yep-yep
Hum, that's what I'm talking about

Man, if I have one, I'll have thirteen
And they can't get me off the karaoke machine
The more I drink the more I drink
Yeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink

Were looking for the King
The new Messiah
Were following the star
Shining brighter
Old man wont you help us if you can
He shook his head but he point pointed his hand

Theres a new kid in town
And hes lying in a manger down the road
Theres a new kid in town
But hes just another baby I suppose
Heaven knows
Theres a new kid in town
Here in Bethlehem

I see youve traveled far
Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new Kings pleasures
I have heard that a King might come
But up til now there hasnt been one


There's so many things we can do this Christmas
Just once I want to go on a ride in a one horse sleigh
Go caroling down the street while everybody listens
Singing Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingling all the way

And if snows just a little too much and there arent no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us
Call up the neighbors and call up a bottle of cheer
Um, there's so many we things can do this Christmas
Ha ha, join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Oh yeah


And if snows just a little too much and there arent no place to go
Baby, if you want you can show me what happens underneath the mistletoe
Hang up the cards from the people we love who miss us
Call up the neighbors and call up a bottle of cheer
Um, there's so many we things can do this Christmas
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year
Join in this celebration, it's the very best time of year

We were talking on a boardwalk
We were lit up when the lights came down
So we drifted toward the music
And you kissed me as the sound
Of my favorite band was playing
But I couldn't hear them 'cause my heart
Was beating loud and out of rhythm
As you drowned out all the dark

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away

We talked for a couple of hours
We got salt all over our jeans
And we laughed about forever
What the hell did that really mean
And all of a sudden thanks to you
My favorite color is blue
I never saw you coming
Sweet salvation and I never knew

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away

I was a town closed for winter
I was a Ferris wheel with the light burnt out
'Til you came along
When you came along

I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away
Yeah you washed it all away
You were the wave the wave the wave
Yeah that washed it all away

There's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out a lot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancing on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There arent no drinking on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights coming through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good

Everybody is running like the end of the world is coming
With a Buffard T kind of law man closing in
She just keeps on rocking guess I better do some talking
She's too dumb to run n' Im too drunk to swim
This can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good

Aww stay tuned

This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good

Everybody is running like the end of the world was coming
With a wildfire burning like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rocking, babe there arent no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumping in

Now you know, when we get to the other side, were going to have to take all
These wet clothes off, and hang out awhile  you know, this could be good
Yea!

Well I've been thinking 'bout it and it's been too long
So put them dirty dishes down and leave that laundry alone
Come on
Take me by the hand and follow me to our room
You don't have to tell me this is way over due
I know, so let's go

I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
And I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I ain't gonna rush it
Girl you're gonna love it
Cause I intend to do it right
But I'll go ahead and warn you
This is gonna take all night

Now I don't understand how life can get in the way
Of me and the prettiest girl in the world making love
But it does

I wanna be with you
Come let me kiss you
And I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I ain't gonna rush it
Girl you're gonna love it
Cause I intend to do it right
But I'll go ahead and warn you
This is gonna take all night

I want to be with you
Come let me kiss you
And I don't mean a peck on the cheek
Girl tonight I'm making up for lost time
I hope you gotta good night sleep
I'm gonna pay attention to every square inch of you
I intend to do this right
But I'll go ahead and warn you
This is gonna take all night

Yeah I'll show you how I love you
But girl its going to take all night

There's music in the city
And lights are on display
There's a big old tree for all to see
Where the children run and play
I look out my window
Something just don't seem right
Till I said hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line

Now it's Christmas, Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama called and said it's time for me come on home

The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
It warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back can get you back to where you belong
Its the difference between just a melody and my favorite Christmas song

Well, it's Christmas, Christmas I'm hurrying' on my way
Christmas, Christmas, like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no jingle bells, just the ringing of the phone
Mama called and said "it's time for you come on home"
Mama just called and said "it's time for you to come home"
Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burnin' through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Once she gets it started
Man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl
Of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on, yeah
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on


Oh, yeah!
One more time, go!
Yeah!

There's a wondrous sight and a joyful sound
Every Christmas Eve in a western town
Gather up the kids, all the friends and family
'Cause the holly's hung and the candle's bright
Tuning up a fiddle on a moonlit night
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree

There's a jolly man in a bright red suit
Did you ever see a Santa in cowboy boots?
Twirling across the floor, spurs a-jingling merrily
As they sing those carols soft and low
We'll all be shouting out, "Cotton-Eyed Joe!"
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree

Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow, there's too much I could miss
'Cause a western guy can't be still, and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree

Red bandanas, kelly green
Silver buckles on new blue jeans
Jumpin' 'round the room to a yuletide melody
I'm gonna be ready when Santa comes
But I'm gonna be dancing 'til he does
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas tree

Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow, there's too much I could miss
'Cause a western guy can't be still, and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree

Waiting 'neath the mistletoe you'll never get a kiss
I never move that slow, there's too much I could miss
'Cause a western guy can't be still, and a silent night is not for me
Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree

Roll back the rug so we can two step 'round the Christmas Tree
Hey!

Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wander the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much
You're missed

Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry, dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all
Two distant hearts can do
Oh-ooh, at least were underneath
Underneath the same moon

Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear
Oh I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Oh hold on please
Won't you wait for me

La la la
La la la
La la la
Oh-ooh At least were underneath
Underneath the same moon
Shadows of the night
Moving all around
Moving on the ground
They follow me around

Leave the radio on just to hear a voice other than mine
Because I can't bear to hear the cold truth running through my mind
Because everything I did wrong just keeps haunting me, it won't let me be
Lying here without you, girl I'm starting to see why you gave up on me
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in my life I'd do it right this time
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give
It kills me to think how much you tried to make things work

I wouldn't listen to you, all I would do is put myself first
I took you for granted and I pushed you away a little more each day
Somewhere inside this hell I have seen my mistakes oh but now it's too late
What I wouldn't give just to go back when you were in life, I'd do it right this time
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again, cause of what I wouldn't give
What I didn't do is give my whole heart to you and that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong and I'll never hold you again cause of what I wouldn't give  because of what I wouldn't give

I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time
Honey you are so persuasive
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time

Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
Cause you can't handle what's on my mind

I don't mean to drive you crazy
Coming off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does

But keep on asking if you're inclined
But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind

Tommy's daddy, kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough
To do what Daddy's did
It didn't take us long to go
From drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house
I stumbled just a bit

You play it cool
But it's no use
Dad arent no fool
And that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover
Up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

We lost Daddy
In nineteen ninety-nine
I took care of everybody's pain
Except for mine
And then one night
My wife took my face in her hands
She said, "I think it's time you cry
For your old man"

You play it cool
But it's no use
She arent no fool
And that's the truth
And my teardrops finally fell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

I could probably do more
To help my fellow man
But life gets busy
And I hope God understands
Someday, when I get time
I'll do more than my share
Funny how I'm thinking this
Sitting in my easy chair

You play it cool
But it's no use
God arent no fool
And that's the truth
And he won't let you fool yourself
You can't hide one single thought
If you try, you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well

When somebody knows you that well

The keys are still hanging in the front door
You're hanging all over me
And in between kisses I hear you whisper something 'bout loving me
There's a half a glass sitting on the table
The other half spilled on the bed
I'm halfway believing you're really meaning every sweet word you just said
Or is it just that bottle of red

When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off

When I wake up in the morning
Will you be in my arms
When the sun starts shining through those blinds
Will you mean what you said in the dark
Or will I have a headache and a broken heart

When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off


I don't want you to stop kissing me now
Keep on loving me laying me down
I close my eyes and hide from these doubts
Do my best to not worry about

When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off
Will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?
Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know

My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?

I'm a rebel
I've been on a dance with the devil
So how'd I get up to your level
You're an angel sent from heaven down to me
I'm rough around the edges
You're a snapshot of perfection
I was heading in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I just got one question

Why me
Out of everybody baby
Why me
You could have picked anybody
Why me
When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask
What did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would have thought
You would wanna wake up every day beside me
Baby why me

I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
Saw you sitting there said well I'm done
And I walked over
Even though you're out of my league
You were diamonds in the sky
I was dirt on a plow
You're all-American pretty
I'm a one horse town
First smile you gave me I was thinking it then
And I'm still thinking it now

Why me
Out of everybody baby
Why me
You could have picked anybody
Why me
When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask
What did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would have thought
You would wanna wake up every day beside me
Baby why me
Yeah baby why me
Baby why me

Why me
What did I do right
Why me
Kissing you goodnight
You say you'll never let me go
Oh it's crazy girl I guess I'll never know

Why me
Out of everybody baby
Why me
You could have picked anybody
Why me
When I see you looking at me
I gotta ask
What did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would have thought
You would wanna wake up every day beside me
Baby why me
She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears
Still rings in midnight silence, in her ears
Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
And if by chance that I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
And if allowed just one possession
I would take her in my arms, to be mine
Be careful how you touch her, she'll awaken
As sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows
That only she can hear, so she goes
Let her cry, for she's a lady
Let her dream, she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, growing wild
Let her cry, oh, she's a lady
Let her dream, 'cause she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild
She's a flower growing wild, she's a flower growing wild

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

When it snows, arent it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

People would say I'm lying
If I tried to tell 'em how we met tonight
They'd ask how many drinks I'd had
Cause ain't no way it  all went down that right
You waiting on somebody and they never did show
You were pissed off, leaving, came back cause you forgot your phone

There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

Then I walked you out to your car, it wouldn't start cause you left on your lights
Then you just shook your head and laughed and said "I guess I need a ride"
Then come to find out your house was just a block from mine
Yeah this is one of those movie scene cool kinda things where the stars align
Just an hour ago...

There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

You cant make up a night like this
You cant make up a story like that
Its one of those
How in the world did it happen
Kind of things
Id never believe it
If I didnt see it girl

There I was, yeah I just sat down in the seat you left
You walked up I said "what are you doing with your beautiful self?"
You rolled your eyes but you laughed and your song came on
I begged you for a dance and we danced
And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up

You cant make up a night like this
You cant make up a story like that
Oh no

You always get dolled up for your party
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year
Cause you always forget that you're so small
You can't take all that alcohol
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car

But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me

I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before
Your headaches and youre fussing and cussing the sun
The makeup you had on your face
Is now all over your pillow case
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball


So baby don't you ever doubt
When father time starts drawing out
Those lines around your eyes

Cause you'll always be
You'll always be
Beautiful
You'll always be beautiful
To me
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
Everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow simple song
Finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way, it's alright
And everything goes wrong
It's a sound of a slow simple song
But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way, it's alright
And everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Daddy doesnt pray anymore
I guess hes finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnt pray anymore

I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace

Daddy doesnt pray anymore
I guess hes finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnt pray anymore

There was a time when we didnt get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
Id hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

Daddy doesnt pray anymore
I guess hes finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnt pray anymore

Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read Gods word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didnt make a sound
This afternoon well lay him in the ground
But daddy doesnt pray anymore
I guess hes finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnt pray anymore
Well up here's the window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row
Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row
When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row

I get drunk and talk to God
I say I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
And I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I tell him why we're through
I tell him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say, "I can't be alone"
And he'll say, "Son, you're on your own"
'Cause when I talk to God I tell him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine, all mine
I know he's a busy man, he'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God I thank him for the time

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God
Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God

We pass in the hall on our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of giving damns
All my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't help, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
It's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend Im a shelter for heartaches that dont have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that Ill say is

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Im not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That Ive never been here before
But you know and I know
That Ill always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But Ill cry to my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Im not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Im not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

Baby, I've been thinkin'

That's why I went and called you
On the telephonr
This bottle's got me wonderin
If you could use a long lost friend
Please, baby please

So I've been here in this bar room
Drowning memories from way back when
So tonight, oh just tonight
Fool me again


I love you and I need you
Let me hold you one last time
Then I can make-believe honey
That you're still mine
Woman, oh woman pretend you love me
Like you did back then

Said, "what's wrong my longtime friend?"
Something's bothering you
Tell me what the problem is
I'll see what I can do
There are times we disagree
We agree more than we don't
We won't always see eye to eye
But we will more than we won't

We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine

If you're on the street, I'll take your hand
If you're hungry, I'll give you food
If it's money you need, I got some saved
If you're sick, I'll visit you
I've been where you are right now
You saw me through it all
I'll lean on you, you can lean on me
I'm never gonna let you fall

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
We got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine

Talk to me, old pal of mine
If you feel you can't go on
Don't you sweat, it ain't over yet
This bond we share is strong
Now, your welfare is my concern
You weigh less than you think
I'll carry you through the sinking sand
See if I'll let you sink

'Cause we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Yeah, we got friendship
The kind that lasts a lifetime
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
Through all the hardship, you know, you're a friend of mine
I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
Get outta hand
A rought and rowdy honky tonk man
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line
Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin' ain't as easy as it used to be
Woo!
I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get out of hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man
That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be
I looked enough that I could have found
A lover that could settle down
I was known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line
That was all that would happen to me
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be
It was hard, hell what happened to me?
This hard living ain't easy as it used to be

I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back, oh won't you let me take it back
I know I told you that I don't love you
And I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back, won't you let me take it back

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby I was wrong

What I won't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
And I don't know why I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that, baby, I was wrong

The postman delivered
A "past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And I opened the door on my knees

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
Because it's the holiday season"
And you fill such a big empty space
But then I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
Because your love makes my life complete

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh!
Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, then for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis

Well she said she didnt love me
And kicked me out the door
Now Im livin in one room
And sleepin on the floor
Think Im gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since Im all alone
I might as well get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Aint got a thing to do
All Ive got is time
The bottles all Ive had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskeys gone
I might as well get stoned

Every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brothers gone
Another mother cries
Now I know theyve got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish theyd all come home
So we could all get stoned

I might as well get stoned
And get it off my mind
Aint got shit to do
All Ive got is time
The bottles all Ive had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskeys gone
I might as well get stoned
Might as well get stoned
Oh, might as well get stoned
Might as well get stoned

They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure so very rare
She made me a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In the beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
Saying "That boy's sure living in luxury"
Sweet luxury

Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on, a millionaire
When the pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than Ive ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time cant erase
And all of the smiles that youve brought to my face
Your loves been so true

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than Ive ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I leave this earth youll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know youll be there
And Ill thank the Lord for the love that we share
Youre heaven to me

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than Ive ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
Sittin' here
It's closing time
You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye
I know a way can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
Nobody's lonely tonight
What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need
What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need
You'll be her
And I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight

She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I cant even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

Cut my teeth on daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a redbone on my side

And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to The Rio Grande
Whole lot like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

Yeah there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran'
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when its raining
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

Theres a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when its raining
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think youre going down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when its raining
You only need a fire when its cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and Ill be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river

Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me

There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river

I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down

The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood

I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I can keep the pain from coming out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Everybody keeps telling me move on
But I can't seem to go anywhere without you
Cause ever since and every single night you've been gone
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes I cry
Cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else


I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love Id known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottle
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didnt waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey

We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I cant remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

Sometimes Im drunk
Sometimes Im stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And Im sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, itll all feel the same way to me

Sometimes Im drunk
Sometimes Im stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes Im drunk
Sometimes Im stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes Im drunk
Sometimes Im stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life
But the devil named music is taking my life

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always had a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then shes gone again

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rolling till Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey, I dont know
Where Im going but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller

My heartbeats rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turning on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rolling till Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey, I dont know
Where Im going but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller

When Im gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

Im just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my hearts behind the pocket of my shirt
Ill just keep rolling till Im in the dirt
Cause Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller
I couldnt tell you honey, I dont know
Where Im going but Ive got to go
Cause every turn reveals some other road
And Im a traveller, oh, Im a traveller

Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind

So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind

Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, til' the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind

If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's lookin' high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind

One wore blue, and one wore grey
As they marched along the way
A fife and  drum began to play
All on a beautiful morning

One was gentle, and one was kind
One came home, one stayed behind
A cannonball, don't pay no mind
All on a beautiful morning

Cannonball, don't pay no mind
Though you're gentle, or you're kind
It don't think of the folks behind
All on a beautiful morning

Two girls waiting by the railroad track
For their darlings to come back
One wore blue, and one wore black
All on a beautiful morning
Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking  my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed and that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
So I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some morning with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'll have to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Cause anything worth havin', Id just lose anyway
Friends worried about me theyd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldnt die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
Im glad to say, Ive come around
But if I could have one wish
Id like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six


I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six


I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band?
In some college town bar
Where it's na, na, na's
And air guitars
Or is it?
Something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still falling
Hearts still breaking
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song?
About someone new?
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad


Is it a feel good song
Gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving
On past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing woh-oh-oh-ohhh
If it's headphones on
On a downtown train
Or the window seat
On an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny?
Or Memphis blue?
I wish I knew
I wish I knew


I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams aint just for dreamers
We couldnt wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybodys somebody, someday
Everybodys got a part to play
Everybodys trying to find a way
To say what needs saying
Everybodys got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that were all playing
You and I, were gamblers holding cards that we cant see
And Im betting on you, youre betting on me

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out, ohh
When the stars come out

Theres a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And its empty so right now I dont feel a thing
And Ill be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But Ill be over it by noon
Thats the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It aint a problem, theyll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, thats something I cant buy
There aint a thing that I can do
Thats the difference between whiskey and you

Ones the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they aint both the same
But ones a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And ones the long gone bitter truth
Thats the difference between whiskey and you

Ive got a problem but it aint like what you think
I drink because Im lonesome and Im lonesome cause I drink
But if I dont break down and bring it on myself
Itll hit out of the blue
Thats the difference between whiskey and you

Ones the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they aint both the same
But ones a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And ones the long gone bitter truth
Thats the difference between whiskey and you

Ah, thats the difference between whiskey and you
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime
The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
I know it ain't
All that late
But you should probably leave
And I recognize
That look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
There's still time
For you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist
All right, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
And you want me to say
That I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
Like a devil on a shoulder
You keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's getting kinda hard for me
To do the right thing, yeah
I wanna do the right thing baby
Sun on your skin
It's six am
And I've been watching you sleep
Honey, I'm so afraid
You're gonna wake up and say
That you should probably leave
Cause I know you
And you know me
And we both know
Where this is gonna lead
I want you to stay
But you'll probably say
That you should probably leave
Yeah you should probably leave
Aw you should probably leave
