I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
I've been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in
I've been looking for a love
Thought I'd find it really boring
God make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh
No no don't leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell me when it kicks in
Well tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken heart
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Broken hearted

Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it, oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

Am I warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, baby, baby, yeah
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah, outside, outside

Is it warm enough for ya inside me, inside me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

Warm enough outside, inside
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough outside?
Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough outside?
Warm enough outside, inside
Is it warm enough? Is it warm enough? 

I grew up memorizing all the cracks in the wall
Staring up at the ceiling watching particles fall
See I prayed every day for a change to be made
And I'd wait to be saved, oh no
Up at night, hiding under covers found my escape
Shut my eyes and let the bass buzz into my brain
See I knew I was destined for bigger and better but never said a thing

I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
With what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls?

Now I wake up to a different bedroom everyday
Living up in the clouds thinking of how it all changed
Used to sit and watch paint dry
Amazed by the limelight
I can't ever be afraid

I assumed there was only room for
My dreams in my dreams so I'd sleep and repeat 'til the moon went home
And I didn't know where it'd take me but made me so crazy in love with it

Then the universe aligned
Oh, with what I had in mind
Who knew there was a life behind those four pink walls?
Oh, the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls

All of the days that I wasted gazing outside the window
Impatient frustrations let out into my pillow
Lied awake at night while my head wandered
And I wondered why
Things weren't different
Everything shifted overnight
Went from "when boredom strikes" to "Ms. Star on the Rise"
It was all in an instant man
But those four pink walls, now I kinda miss them man

Then the universe aligned
With what I wanted all this time
I knew there was a life
Behind those four pink walls
Those four pink walls

Me and Rozmanit
Pulled up to the party
Everyones drunk off their asses
They looking like zombies
RiCKY M$$ told me that it would be fun
But we just walked in and Im already done
Would I do any girls here? How about none
But that girl over there
With the short dark hair
Nah yo back off, I dont want a beer
Yo God why am I here?

Oh God why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none

I moved into the kitchen
So I could be hidden
This girl's telling me how these women are bitching
And that guys over there tryna get her pants
I wonder if maybe if we met by chance
I told her Im a lost boy like Troye Sivan
I invited her over like girl c'mon
We can go back to my place and listen to Drake
I dont even listen to this music theyve been playing
My boys over there lighting blunts and blunts
All this smoke in the air so I had to jump
So I called my mom and told her "Ma come get me yo
So I'll be over here"

Yo I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done

Three years later, still the same
Ain't nothing changed
This so called fame
Is draining lately
I've been shaking
Hands or faces, I won't remember
Won't remember me
It's a catastrophe
False reality, see me with no screen
 about my jeans
So, this industry must not be meant for me

And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

So these are the places you go when you choose not to answer my text?
Pull up to Up & Down, whip out the phone for the Instagram flex
Click, click
She got a job for herself but I know how she spendin' them checks
And don't worry, mama, there's no need to stress
I'ma get my respect
I get that respect, it's no flex
But you trust me, I give 'em what's next
I ain't the prince when I'm in
But you know they be thinkin' I'm fresh
Oh I sit in the cut in the club
But come home and be thinkin' I'm Will
But don't tell the mistress

Tell my friends that I'll be over here

Tell me they love it, they want me, they need me
Surrounded inside of this room by the gritty
It seems like these women is needy
But all they've been wantin' and needin' is money
She callin' me honey, I know that she lyin'
And all she want from me is everything high end
The ladder, the ladder, she love it, she climbin' above it
The higher she gets, she gets no vision from it
The second she plummets she's gon' be right here
The second she plummets she's gon' be right here
At the bottom with killers and dealers
Now they say that diamonds' forever but never explain
That the diamonds fillin' up your safe cannot fill up the pain
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

Some nerve you have
To break up my lonely
And tell me you want me
How dare you march into my heart
Oh how rude of you
To ruin my miserable
And tell me Im beautiful
Cause I wasnt looking for love no
Nobody asked you to get me attached to you
In fact you tricked me
And I wasnt trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that Im asking
Is that you handle me with caution
Cause I dont give myself often
But I guess Ill try today

Cause Ive had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours

Im mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
And altering my rude
Whats wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
What can I do, ohh
And I wasnt trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasnt scared to fall again
But if you promise me youll catch me
Then its okay

Cause Ive had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours

Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming til I see you again
Im not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad Im
Falling again
Falling again

But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
So baby Im yours
Oh baby Im yours

Hey guys it's Alessia and I'm gonna be doing a cover of Justin Bieber's "Love Yourself" because I love this song and I just learned it like three seconds ago so I'm gonna probably get the words wrong as usual but that's okay, I hope you like it. Here we go. And I'm feeling extra cozy today 'cause I have my beanie and my sweater on so very wintery for the occasion. Here we go

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Do-do-do do-do-do
Do-do-do do-do-do
Do-do-do do-do-do
Do-do-do

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Then you should go and love yourself

Okay this is overwhelming
I just spilled water all over myself
For all the g.. uh
Shiiiiiiit
I'm feeling extra cozy today
Okay go away please

My mama don't like you, and she likes everyone

Oh phone rings shitbags

And all the clubs you get in...
With my beanie low, yeah you should love yourself
Lo-ove yourself
I ask myself, you should love yourself
Goodbyeeeeee

Tune in to find my peace and solitude
These empty rooms spin, and I embrace the flaws of being human
The black and white... and sometimes the greys that stay for days
The in between times
The meantimes that make this song of life sing
Play, rest, repeat, read exactly what is written on the sheet
"Don't deviate," they say
But I will play what's best for me
I'll press the keys and pull the strings
Create a symphony that's mine

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Let go
I let my voice be heard, then listen for the echo
My own reverb is playing
Cause I'm a movement
There's dissonance, sometimes I make mistakes
Oh I'm human after all, I'm not your expectations
But play, rest, repeat, that's what they ask of me
Just stick to this melody and stay between the lines
But I'll play what's best for me
I'll ring the bells and crash the cymbals
My harmonious design

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

In my time here, I wanna be revered and remembered
Oh let them say I came, I conquered
So I won't fear and I can't blend in
You can't replace me and you cannot erase me
Cause my song will live on beyond time

And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on
And I'll spend my life penning my song, my song
And the verses I write will speak for me
Good girls don't make history
So I may never be what you assume
Don't want your hooks or auto-tune
If I'm off-key then that's alright with me
Oh and maybe you will learn this when I'm gone
My song will carry on

Run, run like the devils behind us
Run to where no one can find us
Be my accomplice to my crime
Oh baby
Run, run cause were guilty as sin
Run cause we know we wont win
We know together we kill time

Youll never face a judge without me
Youll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then Ill be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time, with you

Well be Outlaws
Well take on the world
Well be Outlaws

Run, run like you never did
Cause they found the evidence
And they found your fingerprints
All on me and baby run
Run like your life depends on it
Lets make forever in this moment
Tell me you love me again, Oh again
And I would waste away without you
Youre the shinin' to my star
Id be searching till I found you
Wherever you are You are

Well be Outlaws
Partners in crime
Well take on the world together
Im Bonnie you can be Clyde
Well be Outlaws
You and me
Theyll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-oh
O-O-O-Ohhhhhh-o-o-o-oh

Youll never face a judge without me
Youll never battle the gavel alone
And if they lock us away
Then Ill be still here
Proudly waiting to kill more time
With you
Oh with you
W-i-t-h you
With you Oh-o-o-o

Well be Outlaws
Partners in crime
Wed take on the world together
Im Bonnie you can be Clyde
Well be Outlaws
You and me
Theyll never understand the honor
Among these thieves
Well be Outlaws

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down, down

I'm trying not to take too much
I'm in over my head
Over love, boy I over trust
Give me the chance to pick up the pieces you left me in
Why did I let you in?
Overzealous, I'm over this
Oh I'm over us
Over and over
I let you under my skin and it's over
I promise never again you'd come over
Something takes over me
I can't control this hallucinogen

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

We fight, we laugh
Detox, rehab
Letting go of what we had
Ohh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Over trying
Over lies
Over crying
Over-traumatized
Over-worked and moreover I'm done
Over and over
I'm falling under your spell, call me over
I'm runnin' back to this hell you come over
And didn't you say we were through?
Why can't I get over you?

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Boy I come crashing, crashing
Down from the high and wondering, wondering
Wondering why this ain't over
Let it just be over
Sobering thoughts taking over my mind

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror, filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fail
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had, I can't pretend
That I don't miss you every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fall
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this, can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more

I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
Go 'head and wish me well
I'll cry a wishing well
I'll fly before I fall
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
"What's a little bit of hunger?"
"I can go a little while longer," she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

My daddy says that life comes at you fast
We all like blades of grass
We come to prime and in time we just wither away
And it all changes
My view with a looking glass wont catch the past
Only photographs remind us of the passing of days
Oh nothing stays the same from yesteryears
See I recall being afraid of the dark
And holding on to teddy bears
Id wrap myself in blankets just to cover me from fears
That was then and now Im here
And the night is mine

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldnt wait 'til I could be seventeen
I thought he lied when he said take my time to dream
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Im Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

My mother said dont forget where you come from, where youve been
Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away
They keep you grounded
Oh keep yourself surrounded with good advice
And yeah I guess that sounded nice when I was ten
Oh but never were there truer words
In all my days Ive ever heard
And when she told me little girl the answer is love
So those are words that I keep with me
Though the seasons change so quickly
Keep them buried in my heart
And never fought

So hear me scream
I was too young to understand what it means
I couldnt wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said take my time and breathe
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Im Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

I been goin on, I been growin up
Im a know it all, I dont know enough
See I was racing and waiting for the day that I would be old enough
Guess Ill be patient and pace myself gotta prepare for when goings rough

I was too young to understand what it means
I couldnt wait til I could be seventeen
I thought she lied when she said "take your time to breathe"
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Im Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Oh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh ohh
Seventeen
Now I wish I could freeze the time at seventeen

Knock on my door, boy come home
You stay in my head
Lay in my arms, why won't you?
It's been way too long
What you waiting on?
Cause I've been laying here
Learning what the memories won't do
See I need you and baby I need to
Let down my guard and give you my scars
Open up my heart

We could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

Rap on my window, come home
It's been a while, so stick around
Why don't you?
'Til the end of time
Say that you'll be mine
An uphill climb fighting what the heart
Really wants to do
See I need you
And sometimes we need to
Shed our facade and be just who we are
All broken and torn, then we could be stars

Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

Piercing lights in the dark
Make the galaxy ours
Kingdom right where we are
Shining bright as a morning
You'll never be lonely
Just promise you'll love me
I'm never too far
And we'll never part
And we could be stars

Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...

Just find  way to get home
There's a space in my heart
Open arms for you to run to
Baby close your eyes and take the leap
To make believe in fairytales
I'll meet you there
Oh yea, I'll fall too
See I've wanted you here
All along but my fear
Just keeps haunting me won't let me go
So it's hard to say I love you

We could be stars...
Oh we could be stars...
We could be stars...
We could be stars...

So much on my mind, I think I think too much
Read between these lines, unspoken weight of words
But time comes to rest when you are by my side, it blurs

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Change in every wind
The sands of time don't know our name
Oh nothing's sure, but surely as we stand
I promise I will stay the same
And I've never seen forever
But I know we'll remain

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Be my stone

In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Oh steady me, be my source of gravity
While my world's unraveling
Say you'll never change, ooooohhhh!!! Oh!

And I will follow where this takes me
And my tomorrows long to be unknown
When all is shaken, be my safety
In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

Be my stone

In a world uncertain, say you'll be my stone

In my room, staying up late
And I'm planning my escape
Cause I know I can't stay
In my veins I got the feeling
Like there must be something more
I've never been so sure

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

These streets aren't easy
And I need your hand to hold
So I'm not alone
And I hear all these voices
Though they try to slow me down
I can tune them out

All night and day
I dream of a place

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

Here it goes
I clear my throat
And cue the violins
Making moves
Shout it from the rooftops
I'm trying to live, yeah

Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
Somewhere far, far away
Beyond the crowds and city lights
Out of the darkness we can shine
So I'm packing my bags
I'm gonna leave it all behind
I wanna open up my eyes
And see you on the other side

To those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

If I didn't pick up last night, I was probably wasting the high
Yeah, at a LA party, it's better you don't have a clue of
None of these girls you have proof of, don't ask why she looking like Rudolph
It's just a one time thing, don't worry ma, it's a one time thing
I'm still the same, promise I ain't changed, though I tried some drugs that I just can't name
You turn wrong to a beautiful piece in a room full of broken hearts

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow
So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

What you talking about?
Bite your lips, shut your mouth and just let go
You've got a cup full of doubt
Come on and empty it out and just say "no"

I know where you're headed
And trust me, you don't want to go
I've been there before, so, so I would know
Got to take the highs with the lows, the X's with the O's
I've been there before and you're not alone

Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight

We dream of glitter and gold
But that can get pretty old, it's just oh well
So maybe I don't have much
But I've got someone to love, and that's myself

Don't know where I'm headed
But I've still got somewhere to go
End is not the end, so, so I've been told
Gotta take the highs with the lows, the X's with the O's
We've all been there before and we're not alone

Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight

Sometimes I feel broke
But it's all alright, yeah, it's gonna be all alright
Sometimes I'm zero
But it's all alright, gonna be alright tonight

Even if it's not all alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright
Even if it's not all alright
We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright tonight


We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright

We are gonna be alright, we are gonna be alright


You only called me your baby when she wasn't there
Now you go calling me crazy because I don't care

We'll never turn back time, now loving you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I wanna do, do is sob

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me

I'll never trust you after the things that I saw
Who wants an ever after if it ain't forever at all

We'll never turn back time, now loving you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I wanna do, do is sob

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me

You'll never be the one
Cause it's not how it's supposed to be
I'll pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love
Baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free
Never be the one
Cause it's not how it's supposed to be
I'll pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love
Baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me

You only called me your baby when she wasn't there

I still feel your kisses in the morning
Even though you're not around
Maybe I should take it as a warning
That my secret's finally... out

And you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
We lay low, but it never feels boring
'Cause my heart is racing for you

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it too, too, too
It's perfect, 'cause there's never any pressure
Baby, you know how to keep it cool

Funny how you get me so excited
When we're doin' nothing at all
Simple as a movie at the drive-in
Or a good long distance... call

But you know that I know that you know just how I feel
And I know that you know that I know this thing's for real
Let's speed off right into the horizon
Or just close our eyes and fall

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it too, too, too
It's perfect, 'cause there's never any pressure
Baby, you know how to keep it cool

 Keep it cool
 Me and you
 Keep it cool
 Me and you

Let's just sit back and cruise, cruise, cruise
That's all I wanna do, do, do
I know you want it too, too, too
It's perfect, 'cause there's never any pressure
Baby, you know how to keep it cool

 Keep it cool
 Me and you
 Keep it cool
 Me and you



I'm gonna make mistakes, maybe twice in the same day
I'm gonna wear my hair up or down
'Cause I don't care what you say, what you say
I promise you that I'm okay, I'm okay
You can call me nice, but I'm not gonna listen
You're wide awake, but I'm better off living
In a dream, in a dream
'Cause that is not reality, -ality

No, I'm not gonna let me down
No, I'm not gonna let me down
And you're not gonna talk me out
No, you're not gonna talk me out
I know that you come around
Yeah, I know that you come around
When I finally get it, when I finally get it
I'm taking the credit

I'm taking the credit

I'm taking the credit

I'm a big girl now, I can handle the bruises
I get lost and found, without any excuses
No apologies, never gettin' one from me
If anybody asks me why, I'll just tell them it's my life

No, I'm not gonna let me down
No, I'm not gonna let me down
And you're not gonna talk me out
No, you're not gonna talk me out
I know that you come around
Yeah, I know that you come around
When I finally get it, when I finally get it
I'm taking the credit

I'm taking the credit

I'm taking the credit

Finally get it, finally get it, won't let you forget it
Finally get it, finally get it, I know you'll regret it
Finally get it, finally get it, won't let you forget it
Finally get it, finally get it, I'm taking the credit

No, I'm not gonna let me down
No, I'm not gonna let me down
And you're not gonna talk me out
No, you're not gonna talk me out
I know that you come around
Yeah, I know that you come around
When I finally get it, when I finally get it
I'm taking the credit


I'm taking the credit

I'm taking the credit

Dare me to reach a little higher
You can dare me to step over the edge
I dare you to dare me to go play with fire
I'm gonna do everything that you never did
I'll leave my footprints on the water
Bet on the dark horse until I'm a millionaire
And you can all sit back and say that I'm a loser
But I don't worry 'cause the truth is in the dare

So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?
I dare you to

I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to

There was a time I was afraid of
The dark and monsters livin' underneath my bed
And then I said, "Enough is enough," simply because
The only monsters were the voices in my head

So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?
I dare you to

I dare you to
I dare you to
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to

Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I wanna
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I'm gonna do everything
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I wanna
Do it all, do it all, do it all 'cause I'm gonna do everything

So go on: dare me to lose, dare me to move, dare me to run
And you can dare me to prove something to you
Is that what you want?

I dare you, I dare you
I dare, I dare, I dare, I dare you to

Stuck between the wrong and the right thing
Can't make up my mind, it's got a mind of its own
Felt a spark, but there was no lightning
Could've walked away, but still I'm coming back for more

Oh, I am loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got the feeling right now
It's alright right now

Stuck between the green and the red light
Can't make up my mind, should I stop or should I go?
Find it hard to leave after midnight
Using the excuse that it's too late to walk me home

Oh, I am loving your summertime kisses
But it's like something's still missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got the feeling it's alright right now
It's alright right now

I got the feeling, got the feeling
I got the feeling, got the feeling
I got the feeling, got the feeling, whoa oh
Oh, I am loving your butterfly kisses
But it's like something is missing
Gonna save quittin' you for another day

I got the feeling that it's not gonna work out
I got the feeling that you're not my type
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like the feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now
Right now, I got this feeling, right now
Maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
Happening 'cause I like this feeling
No, it's not for life, but it's alright right now

Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie, cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Why you, why you gotta be so uncool? 
I told you I didn't want us to continue 

But, it's like it went in your ear and came out on the other side
I guess you didn't wanna hear, but, now, it's time for you to get it right

In case you missed it, or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you


Easy, I tried to make it easy 
To leave me, but I guess you don't believe me 

Running, telling all your friends we're going on another date
Something's missing in your head and, now, it's time for you to get it straight

In case you missed it, or just don't get it
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you

I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
I-I-I don't wanna kiss, I don't wanna talk
Boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all
So don't send me a text, don't give me a call
Boy-boy, in case you missed it, I don't miss you at all

In case you missed it, or just don't get it 
I'm all the way over you, over you
In case you missed it, you need to let it go
And find, baby, find something better to do
Been calling all night 'cause I won't call back
No, I don't like, you know I don't like that
In case you missed it, let me repeat it
I'm all the way over you, over you


Just in case you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you

Just in case you missed it
I'm all the way over you, over you, over you
I'm all the way over you, over you, over you 

Oh, I don't wanna try it
Cause I'm scared that I'm gonna like it
And I can look but I'm not gonna buy it
Cause my heart, heart is on a diet

But you give off something so cool 
So I guess I'm bendin' my rules 

Let's pretend that it's a holiday-ay-ay
Boy, you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss, I'm gonna blow away-ay-ay
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

No, you can't get a witness
To testify about all of the kisses
When it's gone, you know you're gonna miss this
At least you'll check, check me off your wishlist

Yeah, I give off something so cool 
And I'll give a little to you 

Let's pretend that it's a holiday-ay-ay
Boy, you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss, I'm gonna blow away-ay-ay
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

Hurry up, before you're out of time

Better do it before I change my mind

Hurry up before you're out of time

Better do it before I change my mind


Let's pretend that it's a holiday-ay-ay
Boy, you know it's only temporary
Just a kiss, I'm gonna blow away-ay-ay
Like a valentine in February
Up all day and up all night
We're not wasting our precious time
We know it's never going past today
So why not make it legendary?

So come on, boy, hurry up
Before I don't give a what
Come, come on, boy, hurry up
So why not make it legendary?

You got the touch, you got the magic
Making me blush, keeping me coming back for more
Gave you too much, I'll let you have it
It's gonna suck, this is a thing I can't ignore

You almost take me
But you never take me all the way

And I would hate to break your heart
But, I don't wanna waste anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 

Baby, don't beg or buy me flowers
You cannot stay 'cause it would only make it worse
Some other chick who's kiss on your lips for hours
Sure, it could wait, but I don't wanna see you hurt

You almost took me
But you never took me all the way

And I would hate to break your heart
But, I don't wanna waste anymore time on you

I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 

I really like you, but you're not that right for me
I rather wait all my life to find the one
I really like you, but it's just not meant to be
Oh, I'm so sorry, I am, oh yeah

I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 
I could like you 'til the day that I die-ie-ie-ie 
But, I'm looking for the love of my li-i-i-ife 
When you walk past
That park near your apartment now
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
Do you drive fast
When you realize youre on my street?
Do you drive slowly?
Do you think about me?
Thought I could pack up my suitcase
And just walk away 
Leave you with all of the shit I didnt want to take
My mistake
Im missing you
Im missing you
What the hell did I do  did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I dont want new-
I want you
Im missing you
Im missing you
What the hell did I do  did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out I dont want new
I want you

Dont want new, I want you
Dont want new, I want you
Im in his bed
Right next to him, but he dont know
Im just thinking bout you
Im thinking bout you
When its 3am
And Im at that diner with his friends
I ain't thinking bout them
Im just thinking bout you
Thought I could pack up my suitcase
And just walk away 
Leave you with all of the shit I didnt want to take
Want to take
Im missing you
Im missing you
What the hell did I do  did I do?
Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to
Turns out dont want new

Messing with someone new
Thinking I wanted to

New York City, looks so pretty
When you look around
Falling for this skyline, with your hand in mine
As the sun goes down

So before it comes up again
And the questions come rolling in
Like who we have ever been

It was only twenty-four hours chasing
Love we found on the train to uptown
Before it all went down
Why did you have to say it?
Now we learned it's all ending right now
'Cause, baby, I'm on the next plane out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out

Awkward silence
As you stand in line with me, to hail a cab
A little dj v to when I met you
Only this time, it's sad

So before it crosses your mind again
And the questions come rolling in
Like who we have ever been

It was only twenty-four hours chasing
Love we found on the train to uptown
Before it all went down
Why did you have to say it?
Now we learned it's all ending right now
Because, baby, I'm on the next plane out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out

I'm not one to rush, might be more than a crush
And I'm not ready for what you wanna give me
So I'm taking off with all of my thoughts
I'm leaving my heart as a memory of

Twenty-four hours chasing
Love we found on the train to uptown
Before it all went down
Why did you have to say it?
Now we learned it's all ending right now
Because, baby, I'm on the next plane out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
On the next plane out

Could dress up, to get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up in make up and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

I know the other girlies wanna wear expensive things like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be cause I don't wanna be
Cause I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Mr. Right could be nice, for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White, she did right in her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
Cause that's not what a lady's for

The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla, but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Oh I don't know what you've been told
But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty

Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still
I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But no, I won't sit still, look pretty
Sure, I'm a pretty girl up in a pretty world
But they say pretty hurts
And I don't wanna sit still

I'm not the plain and simple, I'm in another lane
I'm rocking Shirley Temple, the cherry on the cake
Just a throwback kid from the nineties
I start my ABC's with the YZ
I paint with different colors and never in the lines
There isn't any other, I am the prototype
Tick-tock, waste time with your rumors
But, I'm so ice cold, good humor

They say, "I'm outta my mind standin' on the outside"
But, it's cooler, it's fresher
I like it here... 

They're all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em somthin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about
Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about

I don't believe in Yeezus, I like 'em Kanye West
I'm rockin' dirty sneakers with my designer dress
Order a Grade-A steak with no pomfret
I wake you up, Starbucks, sleep on me

They say, "I'm outta my mind standin' on the outside"
But, it's cooler, it's fresher
I like it here... 

They're all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about
Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about

No, you don't know what
What you talkin' 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your mouth
No, you don't know what
What your talkin' 'bout
No, you don't know me
So just shut your...

They're all gonna say what they wanna say anyway
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about
I don't really care if they wanna stare, look at me
Might as well give 'em something
Might as well give 'em something to talk about

Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about
Give 'em somethin', a little somethin' 
A little somethin' to talk about

You got that lemonade, but, baby, I ain't buying
Need something hotter to melt the ice
Get you some Gatorade because your mouth is drying
From drooling over me day and night

Can't you hold your horses?
I know you want the cake, but don't skip all the courses

Boy, you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me

You wanna play the game?
Give me a little space and, maybe, you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh


T to the H to the I-R-S-T-Y, you thirsty
You thirsty 

You want that Bottle Pop, you want that Coca-Cola
But I'm not ready to open up
You want my walls to drop, wanna invite me over
Then I'mma need you to slow that talk

Can't you hold your horses?
I know you want the cake, but don't skip all the courses

Boy, you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me

You wanna play the game?
Give me a little space and, maybe, you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh -

Now, I'm not sayin' that you're not my type
All that I'm sayin' is girls never like
Boys who come chasing without any steeze
We don't like them that thirsty
Now I'm not sayin' that you're not my type
All that I'm sayin' is girls never like
Boys who come chasing without any steeze
We don't like them that thirsty

Boy, you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me

Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh
Won't get to first ba-a-a-a-ase by begging me

You wanna play the game?
Give me a little space and, maybe, you'll get a taste
Boy you're too thirsty-ay-ay-ay-ay for me, eh-eh


T to the H to the I-R-S-T-Y, you thirsty
You thirsty

T to the H to the I-R-S-T-Y, you thirsty
You thirsty


Got sixteen candles, make a wish and blow them out
Hoping for those three words, you never say out loud
I know you play cool but I know you think about it
So make my wish come true, and do something about it

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too


I don't know why they say young hearts are such a mystery
Feels like this thing we've got is part of ancient history
The way you look at me, kiss me, is so classic
So let the haters do their thing 'til they get past it

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too

Three, four, five, six
Boy, you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten, you're taking me to heaven
Three, four, five, six
Boy, you're my lucky seven
And I'm your ten, you're taking me to heaven

All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I know I want to
All they're ever saying is we're too young to
Ever fall in love, but I hope you want to too


Hope you want to too

Hope you want to too

Hope you want to too

Hope you want to

Stay out late night, running red lights
That's the air we like to breathe
Breakin' your ties, crossing your lines
Leapin' over boundaries
There's never been a mold that you could fit us in

Doin' what we're born to do is not a sin


'Cause we are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are 
We don't really care, we don't really care what you want 
Never put a we, never put a we in the box 
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm tellin' you we won't stop 

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do
'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

Make our own rules, stickin' like fools
Ready to call the police
We can skip school 'cause we're too cool
To be told we can't be free
You can go ahead and try to knock us out

Ain't no keepin' us from doing what we love 
'Cause we love it too much

We are gonna be, we are gonna be who we are 
Gotta let it go 'cause I'm telling you we won't stop, won't stop 

Because we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are
We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

You know who we are
You know who we are

We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay
We don't hear what you're saying
Being us is okay



We might be reckless, but we're gonna do just what we do 'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are
We are the young, we are the world
You know who we are

Ye-eah-e-eah-e-eah, you know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
You know who we are
We are, you know who we are

Sorry boy, if I'm not that loud
Doesn't mean I'm out, but a word could ruin it
Sorry boy, gotta slow it down
Betta' shut your mouth, do the talking with your lips

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumpin' in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, in the way, oh way, oh way, oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Like you lots, I just had a thought
We could make it fun, doesn't have to have a name
Everyone, puts the pressure on
But we're not everyone, so we don't have to do the same

I'm right on the edge
And I know how to swim, but I'm not jumpin' in
Not scared to get wet
But if we dip our feet, I know we'll go too deep

Don't want a good heart to break
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh
In the way, in the way, oh way, oh way, oh
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way
The words only get in the way

Don't want a good heart to break 
When we're touching, those three little words feel too easy to say
But, but I'm not ready
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

In the way, oh way, oh way, oh 
In the way, oh way, oh way, oh 
In the way, in the way, oh way oh way oh 
We don't have to say love 'cause the words only get in the way

The words only get in the way

The words only get in the way

So you leave tomorrow, just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow, just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave

Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and act like you love me so I can go on

Just one more night lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right, just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning and you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget

Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on

When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream

Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone and I, I'm keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on

Day after day
I will walk and I will play
But the day after today
I will stop and I will start

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says "Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!

Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight

Oh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and bought him a gun
So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me

Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight
Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!

Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts cause

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste and the aftertaste

Never thought that we would end up here
Shoulda known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard

Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air

Always tryna put your two cents in
And expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained

Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in but
All I really need is space

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air air, air, air, air

Tried to hold me down but I'm surfacing
Its hard to let you go but I gotta leave

You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air air, air, air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air air, air, air, air

She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

But that she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself that she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand, it will be alright

But that she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

A little too much
I said a little too much, oh

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
It all gets a little too much

Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know

And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me

We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while girl
Our love is on trial 
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
Cause everything that I do is never ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud 

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough

If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss
I feel powerless and I don't want to split

Stop, take it in
And I breathe for a minute
I think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone

And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I havent seen you lately
But youre always on my mind"

I don't know what
Youre going through
But theres so much life
Ahead of you
And it wont slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes
I can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all

And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I havent seen you lately
But youre always on my mind"

I don't know what
Youre going through
But theres so much life
Ahead of you
And it wont slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah

Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name

Everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone, yeah, I can't stop thinking about you

Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah I don't even know your name

I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
 
Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know
What we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate
 
And I was like ooh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself, woah, clap those hands!
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes

Ah-ah, he-ey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, he-ey
Ah-ah, ah-ah

He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away 
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
She's not coming home 
Coming home, coming home

I know what you did last summer 
Just lied to me, "There's no other" 
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer 
Look me in the eyes, my lover 
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know  

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know  
I didn't mean it, no, I didn't mean it, mean it, no

Can't seem to let you go, can't seem to hold you close
I know

When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more
I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

It's tearing me apart 
She's slipping away 
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone 
She's not coming home 
Oh, na, na, na, yeah

I know what you did last summer 
Just lied to me, "There's no other" 
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer 
Look me in the eyes, my lover 
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been

Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately

Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately

Can't seem to keep you close, can't seem to let you go

I know you didn't mean it, though
I know you didn't mean it, though

Tell me you didn't mean it, though
Tell me you didn't mean it, though 

I know you didn't mean it, though. I wanna know you mean it though

I know you didn't mean it though

Oh there she goes again, every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
You got me thinking me what we could because

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinking we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

Imagination, imagination

In my dreams you're with me we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
Oh there she goes again
Every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
You got me thinking me what we could because
I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love
I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean tide
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinking we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love
I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?
Imagination, imagination
In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me in my imagination?
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

I won't lie to you

I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause its alright, its alright
I wanna make you mine
The way youre lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we dont have to say goodbye
Cause its alright, its alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe Im just a kid in love
Maybe Im just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what its like falling in love
Then I dont wanna ever grow up
Maybe Im just a kid in love
Maybe Im just a kid in love, oh baby
Itd be cool if it was the two of us
But I dont ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I dont ever wanna grow up

Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby theres no pressure, but if youre down Im down
Cause its alright, its alright
To just talk tonight
If youre feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
Its alright, its alright
I wanna make you mine

Maybe Im just a kid in love

But I dont ever wanna grow up

You make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like Im just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I dont ever wanna grow up

Maybe were just kids in love
Maybe were just kids in love, oh baby
If this is what its like falling in love

When were alone and its the two of us

And Ive got it, and Ive got it
And Ive got it, and weve got it
And Ive got it, and Ive got it all, but I dont ever wanna grow up
And I know that we just met
And maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something
From the moment that we touched
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you're lightin' up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby

Your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
Just start tonight
If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights

Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down, like this

You don't find that nowadays
She's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway, oh

Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down

Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I walk down the street and all I can see is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
Sit in your room with nothing to do, victim to the screens between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, disconnection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost

We go out to shows but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screen on our phones? If we're all here together then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tips of our fingers then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, disconnection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost

Tell me how it feels cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark

I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, disconnection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, disconnection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost, I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost

When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of the bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all

You know
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go, oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions

Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises

Time up in the middle of a daydream
Call you up cause the time is wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, dont stumble
We cant do this alone

Where do we go? We dont know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Lets make mistakes and dont look back
Its now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Were young livin' with no fear
Kids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears
We dont have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh we missed the last train
Its that time, and were leaving, home

Where do we go? We dont know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Lets make mistakes and dont look back
Its now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Kinda night you dont wanna miss, time of our lives, one of those nights
Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Kinda night you dont wanna miss, time of our lives, one of those nights

Go home its over, but its not the end
Dont wait til youre older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We dont know
One of those nights, were driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Kinda night you dont wanna miss, time of our lives, one of those nights

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Kinda night you dont wanna miss, time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And its only us now, one of those nights

You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes, yeah

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest, yeah
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah

And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start, letting go
'Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep drivin' me crazy

When you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me, then you say you dont
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
Please, I'm losing my patience, yeah

It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?

It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
'Cause when I think of you my mind goes wild

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You can tell me stop, if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says, don't let me go

I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?
I'm not tryna start a fire, with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

Thank you so much

Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I
I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to go
She'll be the one who breaks my heart
She'll be the love I can't let go
She'll be the light who breaks my dark
She'll be the love I can't let go
But how can I not try?
She'll be the love who breaks my heart
She'll be the one I can't let go
She'll the light who breaks my dark
She'll be the one
She'll be the one I can't let go
How can
How can I not try?

You cant walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You cant watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, I wont listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
Ill jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I will build it from the start
I wont listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I dont know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I dont know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you

Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah

Play the Lotto, you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air, woah

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard, that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air, woah

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big

Woah, yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
Cause something big is happening
Take this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
Something big is happening

Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and its grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big is happening, oh


I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees

I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah

Met this girl when I was three or so
We were holding hands standing toe to toe
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two sides of the story, it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me
Years flew by, was less than twelve
Long division, I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me?
Any time you like and make it work with me
Cause I knew back when if I get you close
When the times is right maybe I'll propose
Baby climb up
Show me the ropes
Sing it

Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let the moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah

So come on girl let me hold your hand, let's go get lost, leave without a plane
And I know you got the world to see, but you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, babe, whatever the cost, yeah
You know me, not the type of guy to sneak around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm dead-dead-dead down to be by your side 
Every night yeah

Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let the moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings

And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
Then baby I won't move, cause I

Need all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever

I want to go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black, when you left me alone
I never knew, she was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore, no more

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past, try to forget you cause it's over
And every time you ask I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head in the middle of the night
When I don't feel right, I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you push me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you push me away
And when you try to take it back, my heavy heart just breaks
But, I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight
You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you push me away
And when you try to take me back
You say someday you will change, but I don't wanna wait

I love you guys, thank you!

I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I notice
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I notice
A little bit shining through the seems

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So c'mon take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls, these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight

We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

Oh, we're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt

I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crime
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Could be everything I need and this could be so different
Now tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better
Than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can, oh

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
I promise I won't let you down

Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh

'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares

'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
We don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-ehh-ehhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
If they see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to god that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am

A-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh 

You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" 
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby
A, B, C, baby
Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

A, B, C
1, 2, 3
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
Baby, you and me
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of childrens'
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me
The one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby

I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart

You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh-oooooh

Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah

Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah
A-a-ay
Beauty and....
Beauty and the Beast

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby

Be my baby, and drive me crazy

If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby, then youll get the chance, the chance to love me
Its obvious I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want, that you want babe
Just show me everything I need to see
Ill give you anything, boy

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby

Kiss me boy and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my

I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that Ill be on you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, on you

How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like were blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like were blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

You're, you're, you're, you're
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're, you're

I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

Manchester!
Put your hands up!

Mmhmm
Hey, hey

Baby, there's a war right outside our window
Don't you hear the people fighting for their lives?
Baby, there's a war right outside our window
But it's gon' be alright 'long as I got you with me

In your arms, I find my shelter
Deep in your love, I will hide
Baby, you and me stop the world when we're together
You find a way to take my mind

Hoping for better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days
Hoping for better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days

So how we gonna stop the violence, stop the hurting?
Stop the hatred, stop the murders
We're all human, that's for certain
Come together, we deserve it
What kind of life will our babies have if we don't change up and make it last?
It starts right here, starts right now
We'll love and hope for...

Better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days
Hoping for better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days
Hoping for better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days
Hoping for better days, better days
Days where things are better
Hoping for better days, better days
Need some better days

I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya
I'll be alright."
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
My broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me, oh
I'll never say "please"
Don't play me, just kiss me

I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh, I'm gonna say things like "shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me, oh
I'll never say "please"
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me, oh
I'll never say "please"
Don't play me, just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up

I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M

Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause he made you perfect, babe."
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say."

A different lover is not a sin

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Now I've been looking for someone
Tryna find a right boy to wear on my arm
I must admit it, it's simply fitting
You were like a cut above the rest, that's why you're winning

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you, my perfect tie
And I never really thought my dreams would come true
Until I laid eyes on you, cause you know you are

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, material
Want everyone to know you're my
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
Boyfriend material, material
Want everyone to know

That you and your perfect smile
Are both timeless and never going out of style
For so many reasons you got it together
When I'm catching feelings, you make me look better

Every night when I close my eyes, I can see you, my perfect tie
And I never really thought my dreams would come true
Until I laid eyes on you, cause you know you are

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, material
Want everyone to know you're my
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
Boyfriend material, material

It's all the little things that you do makes me want to sing
By the way you're talking to me I can tell you've been listening to everything
And maybe it's the butterflies I get every time I hear your ringtone
And maybe it's cause every single text, boy, I told myself you are the one, boyfriend material

Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
That's what you're made of, it's written on your label
Boyfriend material, material
Want everyone to know you're my
Boyfriend material, boyfriend material
Boyfriend material, material
Want everyone to know

Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
I'm coming out, hes coming

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout nothing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Chestnuts roasting at an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe help to make the season bright

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you!

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor
'Cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that

You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen a man with so much dimension

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't want to wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you



Now I can't wait to hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
I'm in love with all your charm

It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile, it's in your eyes
I don't want to wait for tonight

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you

Oh, I want ya
Got to have ya
And I need you
Like I never have lovin' before
Oh, I want ya
Ooh, need you
Got to have ya
Like I never have lovin' before

So I'm daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you



When December comes
I bet you want to wrap me all up and take me home with you
See what I look like under them lights
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime
And whatever is on your list, I'll do it
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it
Uh, yeah

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy, uh
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy

Merry Christmas, here I am, boy

Guide you all the way down, be your nightlight
Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste
Come unwrap me now, been waiting since midnight

I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime

Say you love me
As much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby
Could you do that to me, yeah
Would you lie to me, baby
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
Leave my heart still at the door

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
]
You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back

Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

Basically Im saying here
I cant live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah
Aint no need for contemplating
Promise you wont keep me waiting
Tell me baby Im all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

If I could die

I wouldn't mind
Ay, ay, oooh

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream...

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning, when I rise
You are the first thing, on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Anytime I'm alone, I can't help thinking about you
All I want, all I need, all I see is just me and you

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

It's The Rascals!

I looked in my rear view mirror
And it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead us
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that can be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that weve found it
Well, thats when we start turning around
You're saying, "Baby, don't worry."
But we're still going the wrong way

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talking about us
Sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gonna be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in... traffic
I'm under... pressure, pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on...

Let's just go back, back, back

Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No...

I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me

I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

Yeah
I-I-I...
I-I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I-I don't care about it anymore

I don't wanna be, to be alone baby
Unless I'm alone, unless I'm alone with ya
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't
I hold you close, I hold you close darling
The way that I use to, the way that I use to
Cause it won't be, cause it won't be
Cause it won't be, cause it won't...

There's people on the sidewalk, there's music in the air
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do
Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you

I don't want to be alone for Christmas
Unless I'm alone with you
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas
The way that I used to do
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be
Unless I'm alone with you

Sittin' by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms
Keep from the cold night, you'll be safe and warm
We raise a glass together, to love that never dies
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes
There's no better time to be together
There's no sadder time to be alone
Hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

I don't want to be alone for Christmas
Unless I'm alone with you
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas
The way that I used to do
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be
Unless I'm alone with you

I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just want to hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby say you'll be coming home
X2
I don't want to be alone for Christmas
Unless I'm alone with you
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be Christmas
I just want to hold you close for Christmas
The way that I used to do
Cause it won't be Christmas
It won't be
Unless I'm alone with you

I mean, you know
It's like when I feel really crazy
I just get my broom and fly away
I go real, real far away
Young Money
That's-that's-that's just what we do
You know, I mean we-we wear straightjackets
And we-we-we-we stay in, you know, padded rooms
And, you know, and we fly away

I just came out of the motherfuckin' old school
Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools
Yeah, bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad "woof woof," flyer than a Frisbee
So I'm up in Mandalay, eating mangos
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they say I'm a Star Spangle
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-mon-montana
So fix your antenna
I keep three hoes, but don't call me Santa
And
I am flyer then reindeer in the winter 
Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh, ooo yea

I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, hey yeah

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and
I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that

Ill give you all I have
And nothing less, I promise
Love me, and dont look back
I want you with me on this road to the sky
Well be shining every night, I promise you
Just me and you
Oh, I promise you

Welcome to this Christmas
Only comes one time a year, don't miss this
I just wanna welcome you to Christmas
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen
I'll be singing oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll be singing oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby loves, I'm tryin' to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he calls me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
I think I rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just now
Hell, I just want to look at the moon
How lovely, he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do
You brought me up to my melting point
And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh
Its like youre only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, youll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I cant do this on my own
Cause it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
And all I ever did was love
And it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
I know I did it all for love
Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare
Oh, oh, blinded by your faulty truth
It didnt take me long to see through you
Oh, oh
Its like youre only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling youll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I cant do this on my own
Cause it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
And all I ever did was love
And it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
I know I did it all for love
I took off too fast
I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, Im shoving you down
Theres nothing I need
When youre around
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I cant do this on my own
Cause it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
And all I ever did was love
And it aint right, no it aint right
And I was never good enough
And it aint right, no it aint right
I know I did it all for love
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Yeah, you really tried
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me

You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back

I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ooh
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision

You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey
Taking it right back, baby
I'm taking it right back, hey

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just a little bit, oh yeah
I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none
Oh, babe

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside

Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride


Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside

Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride


Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of...

Just for now, just for now...
Part I: Knew Better

Say you could turn me on

Part II: Forever Boy

Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Oh, be forever mine, you and I
Oh, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy
You're my forever, boy

In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure

Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me if he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him
Used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Loving me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right 
Never had a motherfucker this tight
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me

Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me...

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
Last, last Christmas
You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
You blew it
You do it, do it?

Dangerous love

Danger, oh, how you hold me

Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?

So when you walk out that door
Dont you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

Youre a dangerous love
Maybe youre no good for me, darling
Cause if youre gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then Id rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Ooh, youre a dangerous love, oh

I just broke up with my ex
Now Im out here single, I dont really know whats next
But I aint even trippin', I'mma chill and sit back
And I know they will be coming from the right
And the left, left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one Im feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I dont normally say this but goddamn
You the best, best, best

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess

And if it feels right, promise I don't mind
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you

She say, "you need to stop fuckin' with them thots, boy"
I say you need a real nigga she said yes Lord
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac, shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change
My name change from Lil Wayne to Oooh Wayne
Oh Lord, she grinding on this Grande
Oh Lord, I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that coast guard
And when it comes to that nigga, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love
She says she single and I'm her feature, oh my God

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Hold up, wait
Before you go
Just stay and talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

See, what you dont understand
Is falling in love wasnt part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that Ill ever fall in love, ever fall in love again

Nothing but loving you
Nothing but loving you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
Im loving your loving

Boy you got all my, all my love and affection, all my attention

Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go

See, what you dont understand
Is falling in love wasnt part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that Ill ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing...

Nothing but loving you

Baby, dont you know youve got all my love, all my love?
Baby, dont you know youve got all my love, all my love?

The sun is setting
And you're right here by my side
And the movie's playing
But we won't be watching tonight
Every look, every touch
Makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight

I kiss his fingertips
As I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis
With some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips  on my neck 
Makes me want to give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby
And I just can't stop 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight
Baby, I be fallin'
You are my moonlight
Moonlight
Moonlight

He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When hes holding me tight
And he calls me "Moonlight" too

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know sorry ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

Boy, you better pick one or think twice
Notice I'm the best one to keep by
Guess I shouldn't stay so

...the hard way
It took every ounce of effort just to parlay
Boy, it's always in my favor, it go my way, my way

So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?

You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time

But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better


But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me

Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it 
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better

So what we gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it better
So what you gon' do?
No-no-nobody does it better
No-no-nobody does it better

I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas

Wanna show you in so many ways
365 days

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice

Ooh, ooh

Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I shouldve done you better
'Cause you dont want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldnt give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, Ill let you go
Baby, I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I dont deserve it
I know I dont deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear Ill make it worth it
Cant you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything

J'tais une menteuse, je me suis abandonne au feu
Je sais que j'aurais d lutter
Au moins, je suis honnte
Je me sens comme une rate
Car je sais que j'ai chou avec toi
J'aurais d mieux te traiter
Car tu ne veux pas d'une menteuse 
Et je sais, et je sais, et je sais
Qu'elle te donne tout
Mais chri, je ne pouvais pas te le donner

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille
Plus aucun rve ne me tiens debout

Alors une dernire fois
Je dois tre celle qui te ramne  la maison
Une fois de plus
Je te promets qu'aprs a, je te laisserai partir
Bb, je m'en fiche si c'est elle que tu portes dans ton cur
Tout ce qui me proccupe c'est que tu te rveilles dans mes bras
Une dernire fois
Je dois tre celle qui te ramne  la maison

Tout seul je drive
Si de ta peau tu me prives
Les minutes sont des annes
Quand le cur se laisse aller
Viens, on recommence
On s'accorde une deuxime chance
Rattrapons le temps gch
Arrtons de nous cacher
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
J'pourrais changer d'avis
Mais tu resteras mon seul amour

Et je sais, et je sais, et je sais
Que tu as tout
Mais je n'ai rien ici sans toi

Oui, attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis
Je suis juste un fantme
Attends-moi
Sans toi, je suis
Sans vie, sans idaux
Je sais qu'on ne peut jamais remonter le temps
Pourquoi ne pas s'apprendre  s'aimer au prsent ?
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis
Je suis juste un fantme

Je sais que j'aurais d lutter
Au moins, je suis honnte
Mais reste avec moi une minute
Je te jure que je ferai en sorte que a en vaut la peine
Car je ne veux pas vivre sans toi
Alors une dernire fois
Je dois tre celle qui te ramne  la maison
Une fois de plus
Je te promets qu'aprs a, je te laisserai partir
Bb, je m'en fiche si c'est elle que tu portes dans ton cur

I was a liar

I know I shouldve fought it
At least Im being honest
Feel like a failure

Io coi jeans sempre uguali
Tu giacca Armani
Le firme sui muri
Tu capi firmati
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Tu i viaggi, i regali, le fedi nuziali
Noi al massimo a scambiarci le fedine penali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Giochiamo al gioco delle differenze sociali
Mai stato un tipo da spiaggia o da bagnasciuga
Meglio luomo con luccello che con la tartaruga
Il tuo capo  firmato il mio capo  incazzato
Il tuo capo  firmato il mio capo  incazzato
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but, boy, I couldnt give it to you
Io sono diventato quello che hai sempre odiato
E sono diventato quello che hai sempre amato

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, Ill let you go

Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That were living in a fairytale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone Iever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

That were living in a fairytale, no malice, and no lies
Baby ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone Iever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

La la la la

I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard

And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, youll find out that my heart was battered
Real hard

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Dont it make you wanna dance?

We're gonna hail a cab and don't look back once we get in it

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop, like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city

Pretty, in a pink champagne
Let 'em know our names
Screaming so loud, they'll hear us in L.A
We're popping, like pink champagne 
Popping, like pink champagne 
Popping, like pink champagne

Make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like

We don't need no guest list, everybody's invited
I'm saying, "Even if you can't get in, we'll dance outside it"
We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble
When the line gets flat, gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop, like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city

Let 'em know our names
Screaming so loud, they'll hear us in L.A

If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party

If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party

You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe

Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And Ill never let you go

You should know Im never gonna change
Im always gonna stay
You call for me, Im right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
Youre so different
No one compares
And if you never change, Im gonna stay right there
Ill always be right there

You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, youre on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time

You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you

And if you never change, Im gonna stay right there
Ill always be right there

You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you dont mind a drive-thru
Thats why I got you
And Ill never let you go

You should know Im never gonna change
Im always gonna stay
You call for me, Im right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
Youre so different
No one compares
And if you never change, Im gonna stay right there
Ill always be right there

Ill always be right there

Spinning round
Soaring Free
Steady now your gonna make me scream and shout
Tryin land it's rushing down
But light and sound is spinning round
Tryin land it's pouring out
You make me want to scream and shout
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster
You got me going around in circles
Like a rollercoaster

You make me go round
You make me

Go round

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your **** bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do 
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hands

And you played it to the beat


Baby, I have no story to be told 
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn 
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared 


The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling 

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow


We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all, it all

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat

Santa baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lie
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey, the one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
But I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry tonight, hurry down the chimney tonight

Waiting
Hurry, tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let it snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's...

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's...

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If ya won't be, if ya won't be here

Ohh-hoo-wooo-wooho

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year can you...

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah
This year can you...

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

I know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California

Sober, when you come closer
Boy I know I know you've been trying to quit
But you let it show

Boy we're kissing now
Baby when I'm with you
I'm wasted

Sober, when you come closer
Boy I know I know you've been trying to quit
But you let it show

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all cause of you

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all cause of you, boy

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dared to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why
Oh why can't I

So sure I'm just about to fall for you
But you don't even try and catch me, so I

Boy, you might be falling but I think I better not
My heart's still mine
I'm gonna take my time, but

Don't leave cause there's something about me and you
You gotta stick around, stick around around
Oh, You gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found
You gotta stick around

Any other guy would fall at your feet
They think I'm crazy but they're nothing like me
I've always been the kind to think things out
And I'm kinda wondering what you're all about
So I

I make my mind up, I make my mind up
But boy, you gotta know that I'm not in a rush
I'm a fun girl not a dumb girl so
Wait a minute

Till I got you all figured out
You gotta stick around, stick around, around
Oh, you gotta hang 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
Take a look, take a breath
Take a chance on everything I've said
Take your heart. And take your time
And maybe one day you'll be mine
Ohh, maybe one day you'll be mine. 
Yeah!
You gotta stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hang round' if you wanna find out if it's
Love baby, real love, love baby we've found
Stick around, stick around, round
Oh, you gotta hand 'round if you wanna find out if it's
Love, baby, real love, love baby we've found
You gotta stick around
There you come with your big brown eyes and I'm
So sure you've got me mesmerized
Stick around
I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same
Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes
Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore
Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone

I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you, oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you

Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you, baby
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you

Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory

I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you
I'm just thinkin' bout you
I'm thinkin' bout you, I'm thinkin' bout you

You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Down if we get too close
Down if we get too close

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Down if we get too close
Down if we get too close

All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, all my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, all my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, all my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, all my ladies, make noise

But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Down if we get too close
Down if we get too close
Down if we get too close
Down if we get too close

How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me when you're not really there?
When you're not really there
How do I feel you on me when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Oh yeah, baby, just come on in

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger just for the night and forget?
Baby, let's just forget
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Ain't nobody gonna touch it

Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's be in love

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna
Baby, ain't nobody gonna

On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said 'I love you" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
My true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love

You are my true love

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
And nothing's shining more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love

You are my true love

I wanna mix a potion up
Make a special drink for you
Mmm-mmm
Just a little sip
And you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah, when I'm through
Oh, yeah

Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and stay through thick and thin
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little drunk
And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

Boy, I really knew you were the one
The moment that I saw your eyes
Mmm-hmm
Strong, and wise, and sweet, and quiet
Yeah, you're just my type
Mmm-hmm

Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and be my shiny prince
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little high
But we'll be so enchanted and you'll feel so alive

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

I always get just what I want, and boy, I really want you now
So just say "yes"
Can't second guess the power of my voodoo love
My voodoo love
My voodoo love

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

I've been living with devils and angels
Angels, angels

Same boat, yeah

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown

Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Come and kiss me, baby
We don't need no mistletoe
We don't need no fireplace
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas?

Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas?

We don't need no presents
We don't need that kitchen
We don't need them recipes
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread
I'm made with love

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play
'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas?

Are you wit it?
Are you wit it?
Are you wit it this Christmas?

Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
But they don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then

I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing my dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

My love

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, its overkill
Dont get mad at me 'cause youve been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe itd be different
If you spoke, I wouldve listened
But now, Im with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been
If you wouldve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta 
Boy, you shoulda 
'Cause you didnt know, so
Now youll never know, youll never know

Now its probably hard for you to hear
But theres nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, but you dont understand
Is a girl like me dont have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe itd be different
If you spoke, I wouldve listened
But now, Im with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

You will never know what we could have been
If you wouldve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta 
Boy, you shoulda 
'Cause you didnt know, so
Now youll never know, youll never know
Youll never know
Boy, you shouldve told me, told me
Youll never know
Boy, you shouldve let me know
Youll never know
Boy, you couldve been there for me
But now youll never know, youll never know

Its not my fault
Youre a little bit too late
Youre the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance youll never get back, get back

You will never know what we could have been
If you wouldve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta 
Boy, you shoulda 
'Cause you didnt know, so
Now youll never know, youll never know
Youll never know
Boy, you shouldve told me, told me
Youll never know
Boy, you shouldve let me know
Youll never know
Boy, you couldve been there for me
But now youll never know, youll never know

Boy, youll never know, youll never know
Youll never know, youll never know

Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone

Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid 
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy?
]
You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only
You're my only shorty

You're my only shorty

I'm telling you the truth, 
Girl, it's only you, 
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty


Every day and night you've got an open invitation, 
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy, 
You're in demand, but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you "bye, bye"
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy?

You're my only shorty

You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only

You're my only shorty

You're my only shorty

I'm telling you the truth, 
Girl, it's only you, 
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty

]
See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed 
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave 
I don't need to bring in all the attention 
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?
]
You're my only shorty

You're my only shorty

I'm telling you the truth, 
Girl, it's only you, 
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only, one and only

You're my only shorty

You're my only shorty

I'm telling you the truth, 
Girl, it's only you, 
You're my only, you're my only, you're my only
You're my only shorty

Am I your only?
Am I your only?

Tell me, am I your only shawty?

Why won't you say that?

Am I your only shawty?

Hercules
Hercules

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one

Now he's a honcho

Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

When he smiled, the girls went wild with 
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the glad in gladiator?

Whose daring deeds are great the-a-tee?

Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, 
Not conceited
He was a no one

Now he's a honcho

He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeed



Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up 
The 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga


Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise 
They got me feelin' like the one again 
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri

Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Baby girl on that Mclaren
You gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood
You're from Timmins and I'm from Toronto
You worked at McDonald's and I eat McDonald's
We should be together, I think we should be together
All these other girls they're totally crazy, oh, oh, oh
Only you can make me feel the way I feel
Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, baby

Drop down, drop-drop 
Drop down, drop-drop
Drop down, drop-drop, get it, get it
Drop down, drop-drop

Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it

I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it

They don't work hard as you, damn that's so crazy
At the end of the night when you count, numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl you just did it
I get it I get it, man fuck all that talking, take shots to the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a come up baby don't you ever forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
The spark ain't enough for you

Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it

I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it

Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
They can't wait until it's all finished
Shine on them hoes, let 'em know that you run shit
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
281 to my city, heard you had trouble at customs
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
I get it I get it, what's up for the night?

Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down

Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
We're not in Kansas anymore

Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talking bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga
Out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champ, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was popping off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doing macarena
But who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know

I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up

44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew

I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates

I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
Take yo self a picture when I'm standing at the mound

Yeah, all you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden, I got people
Showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, "Ha-ha-ha, ha"
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me
When I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down, especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that, no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs, then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or "Where my bitch at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, White, and Red on my body
'Cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Ros and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder
Just to hit the Kush upsponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop
On some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you
Make you dance to this, yeah, I make you dance to this
I rode big body, widebody, Calabasas road winder
Sunshinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keysh right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try and reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find
You SWV 'cause you weak
And I'm always, always on your mind

Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this
I'ma make you One Dance to this
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bod breed, bod bwoi

Yeah, this on some "old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit
You know? For my niggas, though

You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like there's wire taps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list
Nigga, fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like Im seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon, this shit for Julius, Milly Mill
Boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin' to win here again  man, what's up?

Yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah


Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy 
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy 
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it 
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it 
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy 
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys 
I give a fuck about old boy 
I give a fuck about his squad, boy 
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing 
I'm about to say a true thing 
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now

Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... 
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift

Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift


Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift


Work the night shift
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift


If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you gotoh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds
On my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose
You should've kept it insideoh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a How-To manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures
And whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this yearfuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love itbut they scared of the truth
So back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the cityyou gotta love it

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line
So they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace
But I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go
I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it






All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it






Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....

These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel Thats it Ahhhhhh

Ho, Yeah, Uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more


When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me 


It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
Baby it's about the game

Promoters on my ass so im guessing they filled

But its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar

To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust im hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me
Now a day i peep they intrests
Specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
This knowledge if you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money then lovers seperate for I commit the date up
I put a split in the middle then i seperater

Baby it's about the game
Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
No love for these bitches I said this year its all business
It is a shame that a couple of em are off limits
No offence to my nigga, its just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin
I know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Dont let them fuck your life up
Half a mill to perform, I cant let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when its lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
Just got a couple Warhols for my hallways
New verses crush the hood like Im driving into something
Bitches on the kid like Im Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!



I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ringdogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
 She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested 

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and Im bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking bout who next
But Im about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
Im the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
Its not your turn cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that Im on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And Im on the road box office sales
Im getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythingeverything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back 
Im blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn thats a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I dont listen to you
'Cause I dont like being lied to
And that ship wont sail
And that wind wont guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

I said tell me what's really goin' on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a mothafuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
 Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lotta ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call the King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin' basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everythin'
And Drake just stands for Do Right and Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl I'm fuckin' serious I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin' cause it's on

You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night
I'm with if you with it

Tell them open up the doors, they gotta let us in
It's rap oldest rookie and it's youngest veteran
Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'mma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us
Goddamn we killing it, ya kids gon' have to hide us
So if you ain't coming with us then you gon' have to write us
Cause it's on


Ooh shit, mothafucka, goddamn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money everyday: I'm a groundhog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin' I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talkin', shut the fuck up, ho

Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for Front door
Cause that's where I bring it, Soo Woo if you bangin', muthafucka

This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love !!

Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!

UH, UH, UH 
YEAH YEAH 

They say he wanted the bounce back
I can make them easily admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't explain myself, All this Love !!

Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love !!
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love !!

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings

From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck

It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, an back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh Im ready, alright J fresh I got 'em
Look, Im really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell Im on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money thats why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one Im the zero, 
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
Im Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You dont want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff dont act like you cant see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at me

Riding 'round, my city, my guys chase the cream
Riding 'round, our time coming waiting patiently
How bout now?
Juice box I got. The juice box you want. The juice box I got

Making them things. We got the sound
Don't want the fame, but make momma proud
Let her know I got us from now

Deuces we throw up. To all these hoes, luck. We don't wish em none
My tribe be the set I rep. Trying to have my brother buying diamonds

Too much that I see. Dealing with a lie
Only want the wings. If ain't that then so what
Too much that I see. Dealing with a lie
Only want the wings. If ain't that then so what

 Hold this. Is what I tell my homie passing the dutch
Only smoking gas remind me to stop
I forget about it pray I bless up
Wanna throw dollars and not give a f**k
Hope I never come down feet hurt. Can't let em touch the ground
Said I can't help  now. Wonder my girls still down
Losing losing . Choosing to do this
Losing losing. Choosing to do this
Juice box I got. The juice box you want
Riding 'round, my city, my guys chase the cream
Riding 'round, our time coming waiting patiently

But when you're all alone I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do

Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it

Oh, ohit's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio...

Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a proteg, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
I swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?

Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
The type of life you first timers could soak in
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch
I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
You was having hoop dreams
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Young money old accounts
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man 


She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
Im the only one she loves
Theres no copies of the key
Homie, thats a guarantee

Dont forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin
Other dudes would suffocate her, I dont want her gaspin
Dont know where shes going
And I do not plan on asking at all
Ive never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
There's too many in the world
Homie, you can have your pick
But I swear that ones my girl
I swear that ones my girl!

Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again

Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what youd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga 

Lyrics to Drake's song "Bad Breed" will be available when Views From The 6 is released on April 29th. Please continue to check Rap Genius for further updates!

Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin
Its obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady

My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we denied from the back
You can die where from, or die where you at

Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they don't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
Lend me ya kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Hope that I see you, see you


Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

What we doing Drake? 
What we doing Drake? 
Take your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold
So bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old

It's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin
Watch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes
"It wasn't me" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya
And I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella
Got wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers
Kidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa


Give me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars
I want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar
I would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now
So I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile
My sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me
We're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities
I probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished
I don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist


I'm black and Jewish
Don't be so foolish
I'm black and Jewish
It's a Mitzvah

Please don't forget I'm black, please don't forget I'm Jewish
I play ball like Lebron and I know what a W-2 is
Chilling in Boca Raton with my mensch, Lenny Kravitz
The only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz
At my show, you won't simply put your hands in the air
We can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer
Like Baruch Yitadel Yisrael
Ve'et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West, amen
I eat Hova with nova, knishes with my bitches
A bagel and cream cheesy with my boy, his name is Weezy
Do not go to Feingold's, though
The pickles are rubber
And I will not be harming ya
I read the Old Testament, okra and matzahball, I'll eat the rest of it
I celebrate Hanukkah, dated Rihannakah
Birth right in Israel, mama from Canada
Daddy from Africa
Best of worlds when you're Jewish with black in ya
Challah!

It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
Go ahead claim it
I'm about to paint a picture
You niggas go ahead frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
 and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers a clich
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be in your face
Like no speak-a la ingles
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
Cause I've done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad cause his girls at the house
With her tongue sticking out
Like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby, they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, naww not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive cause it's not a fugazi
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't trynin leave you broke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm
And here's another hit barry bonds
It,it,it was just you an i
A-all those wonderful times
I-i can't deny
You got me wrapped around your finger
All those beautiful lies
With your beautiful eyes
Through your beautiful smile
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like

Well if ya love ya girl
And wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin up and askin me to meet ya girl
Cuz I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girls
She winked her eye on the side
I seent ya girl
Better treat your girl right
Cuz another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz u leave your wife
And I see ya wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin the life
You just gettin it right
Your old lady look at me
Cuz you ain't hittin it right
She probably used to like you
Cuz you the better type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass look with dick in her life
I noticed she was checkin me
And diggin the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that right
You know smack that thang
Sit that right
Upon that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pullin on her hair
Like we gettin in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll swell just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
Cuz u might catch me
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt
We playing in my glan in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
It,it,it was just you an i
A-all those wonderful times
I-i can't deny
You got me wrapped around your finger
All those beautiful lies
With your beautiful eyes
Through your beautiful smile
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like

Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top
I was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls are thick
And the hottest nigga rap 
And if you lookin for the good and we got 'em
In the trap like 
Took em from white sneaks to 
This metaphor might sound a lil confusing but

I done come a long way from a days inn
And all hotel that i stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now we see it's sitting at amazing
Girls trying to ho lobby us
Hear 'em all screaming and it's prolly us
But i can't blame females
Females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when i strut through town
Two or three days and i'll shut you down
Chillin with the homie trey songz
You call him the prince
He rep two up, two down
Anyone i know get used to me
I'm far the man that i used to be
And i don't ever really kick game
And i know you find it impressing when you're introduced to me
It,it,it was just you an i
A-all those wonderful times
I-i can't deny
You got me wrapped around your finger
All those beautiful lies
With your beautiful eyes
Through your beautiful smile
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like
Oh,oh,ohhhh, ohhh
Got my heart broken in pieces like
You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah

Here we Gooo
The 1st time around
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look

Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go

It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh

Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Holla!

Im so f*cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
Theres a diamond on my d*ck so that's a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby cuz I romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
It's nothing on the God son that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, getting p*ssy just isnt one
Girls are like buses every 15 mins they run
Now there like potato chips I just can not have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
And I don't feel like you deserve a visit
Cuz you ain't in the kitchen with me water whipping

Uh, uh ahhhhhhh
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prolly tell that sh*t to everybody
So, we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you

Uh, ok Im all about it, all for it
Im all-star Team Jordan, small forward
Im never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so Im shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, f*ck is up, now man Im in this hoe
Life is moving fast, where the f*ck do all these minutes go?
Mixtape dropped then I started getting ten a show
Now I get a hundred what the f*ck you think Im in it for
Young Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay, and Mack agree
F*ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend n*gga lately she distracting me
Wondering if Im the best, well I am no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna f*ck you, n*ggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you


Ain't that your girl
Ain't that your money
Ain't you the same n*gga that say she want do that, you funny
You a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave 'em four, he gave you two, you f*cking dummy
Classic line, b*tches run like buses
Gucci say that n*ggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it n*gga
She ain't stupid, go turn up your radio
Im the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a f*ck about doin' a f*cking cameo
We dont love em, we dont love em, we dont love em, no
They just love us, they just love us, cuz we stack them Os
Cuz we whip it, watch her whip it, when she whip it
All us gunna hit, once they mention catching feelings
Two words, I'm gone


Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like

I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up

I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them, but
This is not to get confused
This one's for you

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there 
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best, you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

Uhh, ah yea
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money, yeah, yeah
You know who you are


Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you

My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight
So if you with me clap ya hands
I'm about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it
Between me and you
Verse 1: Drake
I love these cold nights my breath light and I slide through to your crib
Got my mom's car my phone off cause I don't want to leave here
Girl the moon peakin' the sun leavin' let's watch it disappear
Got the heat on the music low so you all up in my ear
I keep yawnin' and yawnin' like I'm gettin' tired
You keep telling me that I need to head home but I don't gotta work so it's fine
It was just eight but now it's three what happened to the time
It don't even matter we having fun so really girl I don't mind
Got my diamonds all on my neck and all this gal 'o mine on my face
With yo' soft lips and your long hair that go down to your waist
If we fuck now I might pull it I don't care if it's fake
Oh you got to work in the morning girl you might show up late
It's been one hell of a night with you I don't mind it at all
Heard you break hard so I'm prepared to pick up the pieces that fall

Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? Ive had too many
This Virginia done me off already
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel

Don't switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel

'Cause I know what I like
I know how I wanna live my life
I dont need no advice
Youre not here and we both know why
So, move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
Im buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, Ill go crazy

Dont switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, hes a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel

I know we cant keep it together forever
'Cause youre crazy sometimes
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
Im buildin' up a house where they raised me
You move with me, I'll go, look

Dont switch on me, I got big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no spray tans
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, hes a wasteman
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel
Im blem for real, I might just say how I feel

Together forever
Good morning, good afternoon, good night!
I'm here to talk about More Life
One second
Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bring dubs I've heard too many
Unruly we done you off already
Sound dead for real, I might just say how I feel
Yeah, sounds dead for real, I might just say how I feel
I heard that Tinie Tempah dem are big fans
I heard there's a funeral today, you needa make plans
Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I am confident and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask...

Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New 
Is anything I'm doin' Brand New?
Brand New 
Girl


This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask...


Is anything I'm doing Brand New?
New 
Is everything I'm doing to late?
Late 
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, Am I too late?


This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new


This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl


This here on some remix shit seems like ever thing I do they leakin it and I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride. so she still think im confident and damn, how long will this last while life is on the pedastool am I moving to fast? Feel like im in crazy competition with my past that's why I gotta ask.. is anything im doing brand new

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new


Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew betterand dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..

Is anything I'm doing brand new
Is everything I'm doing too late
Did he take off your clothes off just like this

Tell me baby am I too late?

And this is the remix baby weezy baby,drizzy, yung mula baby

Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yes, I'll be there
Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away 
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me

Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me

I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yes, I'll be there
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me

Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me


If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
'Cause you are the death of me
If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
'Cause you are the death of me

Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died


Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before

Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

Can I? Bring you to the six where I really stay, Baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, Baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, Baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, Baby?
Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out, one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I? call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I? see you right now, I know the sun is up, Baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I? ever make you feel like I'm down for you, Baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I? finally take the time and open up to you, Baby?
Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I? Before I turn the lights out, one more time
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy but I'm still the man
Come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands
Then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you realI don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17

Want a lot, can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

Can't have everything
Can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything
But I want everything

Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face
Watch with the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up and scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because Im confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.

Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man

Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home

Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh
Yea JD Era I see ya
Mayhem maury er I see ya
Yea that's the coalition
D-10tion boi-1da the commitment
Heartfelt music
Andreana I see you baby
Sox yea, row
You know
Uh, we keep it goin, there's no stopping it
Its my year its my summer my decade
Yea you got an entry flow, you gotta stick around for the whole century flow nigga
That's how I do it holla at me
And thats it

I told you from the jump, me and you just friends
Never did date cause I knew that shit would end
Made you upset when I told you how it is
Now we don't talk, but ever since then
You been worrying about a nigga, and you calling my phone
Looking for info through my songs
Accusing me of shit, girl you know that's wrong
Trust me when I say, that we better off alone
Know you hate it cause you want someone else
You really shouldn't focus on me
You need to worry 'bout someone else
And as you can see, I've been doing my own thing, 
I'm trying to make this move
You're a diamond under pressure
But you always kept it cool
And I told you play your role
You know you just decide
You say that you want to leave
But don't know how to decide
But I know you want to stay
You ain't going to find nobody realer
You caught feelings like a nigga was a picture

Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
 don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings

Dammit, dammit darling I gave you warnings
And I needed space like a fucking martian
moreover, super sober
I needed room as if I was Marvin
Slow but surely
Darwin's theory
Hearts revealing an eerie feeling
As time gets even, never place queries on me
You yapped too much about the penny ante
This mechanic is so uncanny
Trying to grind a Grammy up for ya mammy
Implode a plan up then expand it
Things grow, wonderful
Dreams become your growth
Forever under oath
Rollie gold 'til i overdose
Girl, you know you was throwed the most 
Well, Ex X'd Tisk Tisk
Fly to shit around a lit wrist
Nigga that, Bitch this
Oh well, you're dismissed!
Like school-bells & Dipshits
The truth was never distorted
No strings attached, we were cordless
It's important to be smart and gorgeous

Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
 don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings
Told you from the jump, don't catch no feelings
I told you, you would get hurt, in the ending
Yeah, I told her, I said, don't catch no feelings
Don't catch no feelings with me girl

All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know

That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious

I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Hm
This is celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now, this took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official competitor elimination
I was taking trips with Web to move weight
Came back to queens then hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up crack up in the stash
50 cent Italian, icy flow
It's that run and get a dollar for a ice cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing biz
This one is for TT, Tweety, Viola, Sharika
Candice, Timby, Lauren, Iesha
It's a celebration
Put it up for the ghetto
It's time like these
They know who we are by now
They know who we are
Champion, a champion 
Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to comerica
Fucking terrabus got me acting out of character
Young TO nigga, either riding' range
The Ferrari top down, screaming money ain't a thang
Tell me when I changed, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know
Makin' hits in 3 acre cribs
Cookin' up tryna eat nigga steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches but they good to me
I make her do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck tryin'a get where I'm at
Straight like that
It's a celebration
Put it up for the ghetto
It's time like these
They know who we are by now
They know who we are
Champion, a champion 
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin, mello
Tell me one thing you won't do, settle
Gimme one word for ya chain, yellow
Pocket full of money, black card, ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A I?
So how you deal with the fame, stay high
Stay putting down for the town, may I
What you call a crib in the sky, play high
Half a mil in 3 weeks, y'all did it like a champ
Mama taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing
Don't let me in son, hundred bottles of the ace
Lemme in son, go money cases in my place let's celebrate
It's a celebration
Put it up for the ghetto
It's time like these
They know who we are by now
They know who we are
Champion, a champion 
What up Nicki, it's nasty
Yeah yeah yeah
I sold my first 2 million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man yet I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga fuck, murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bimini
You can see me on a yacht blasting Pac, little nah, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging bitches that can make it and kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother's sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My 10 year old plan just one year 'til finish
My list went like this, first thing to sever
The difference in pussy white black Latin or other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter while writing my next chapter
Fast cash life, happily ever after
Champions
It's a celebration
Put it up for the ghetto
It's time like these
They know who we are by now
They know who we are
Champion, a champion 

Stop, stop, stop...
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
Thats why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
Im so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases
All yall stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent cause we at war and Im very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope youre prepared to face him
Im charged up, Im charged up

Wow, Im honored that you think this is staged
Im flattered man, in fact, Im amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, dont it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they would push a button
East egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it aint like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like Im Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
Im charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas aint about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
Im trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, theres something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasnt done you niggas any good
Its sound, sound, sound til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you bout to starve us?
Niggas aint about to starve us
Nah, Im charged up


Have you seen me?
Im doing so good
Everytime I leave
Oh, Im so sorry


You know, I kept it real
It aint too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch ass shit all day long
Industry people....regular people...
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and thats weak
Lyrics to check it out
Verse one Drake
Its been a long long day
A long long day
Say you gotta go

Come on I know you wanna play
We can light it up
Switch it up
Or burn it up

Play spin the bottle
We can play a game

Lets go that extra mile

Verse 2 Drake
Its been a long long day

You back in town
Dam you look better now
Loosen my collar
Top dollar
Got the money, the cars, the clothes
Missing the extra
I regret that day
Wish I never stayed away
I never guessed how much I would pay
And yeah I payed
Life goes on
But im holding on
Stuck in the past
Dunno whats going on
I guess its my loss
But at the end Im the boss
Chorus drake
You know it, oh you know it
You know, oh you know it
You gotta check it out
Check it out
Check it out

Breaking news, my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
She's fucking somebody on the basketball team
If she's at the game

Right, right, yeah
I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Momma is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood
Don't make me give you back

I say bounce that shit like woah
Yeah, bounce that shit like woah
This is not a fairytale, I already know how you like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, heard all of the stories about you
I already know and I like it
Take you to the mall and get you a new outfit
Girl, that's just some child's play
Bounce that shit like woah, yeah
Bounce that shit like woah

Yeah, rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah

You don't wanna fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?
Riding...

She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a jungle soldier
Rode that dick like a soldier
She rode it like a soldier
She rode it like a Melpomene soldier
Burrrrat stick it, b-burrrrat stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it

Thank you, thanks Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired, boss


This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim

Yo, the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

Yo, the city is mine 
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down

Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like 
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it 
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I know it" 
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF 
Miss Andreena Mill

Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X 
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And "Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
 lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man

They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rose Mary? Even Leanne Sealey?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go", it's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like "why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a mothafucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fucking love
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit -- I swear it's sounding like home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
But, its not copy do it, its the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Well, you ask plenty musicians -- them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here


I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost
I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to
Act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain
How I am no good so go with the next man But dog
You don't know me
You don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F
And any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and
I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out
Nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you
Like me and my team
Not us so you knock us
That's precisely what I mean And dog
It's forever clear
My money evergreen
My presence required in places
You have never been
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And who's Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel one the curb
Ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I
Just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity
None of them as hot as me
The industry standard
So I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is
Like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been
You a has-been a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire
And gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this
Summer I did it prior
I've shattered shows
In tattered clothes
Met status quos
This is the south and I am
Present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay
Attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl
Don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"
You mean Ros?
Why yes it is
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style
Your in need of ya own, man
Verse 1: Drake
I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
You don't need it
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way 
Verse 2: Kyoko
Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way 

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight

Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is

And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
]
I miss you, most of all, my darling 

 Strolling in the park 
And watching winter turn to spring 

Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing



I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive

Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
That shit was wack as fuck
I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better  make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-stripper-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me, I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift

I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby

Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
When she get too on, we take if off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip right now, Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip right now

Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach
Just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself!
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
...I'm next to blow -- pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love - X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prol'ly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I gotcha dream girl ridin in ya dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin
I hope they document what I'm becomin
Congratulations

So whatchu want an award or sum'hin?
I'm at the private airport boardin sum'hin
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if ya bluffin
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a Monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world records - no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or sum'hin
My deal like Weezy first week, one point sum'hin
...And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it dooow-haaaah-owwwn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass -- PAUSE
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck wit y'all, then don't bo-ther him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't fa-ther them
Right, uh

It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
...Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off yo' chest~!"
...and I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin, I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office - same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

It's crack!
Aiyyo Drizzy, you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like, "Congratulations - it's crack!"
Yah
It's crack, hehe, congratulations
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

"Theres 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"

Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
Yeah, swanging

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here,just swanging

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'

Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I'll be there just swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, ohh
Oh, They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Whoa

Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

Coming Soon...


Why you keep askin' me about ?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

Why you keep askin' me about ?
Couple other things Id rather do than talk 'bout that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
Hes not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me


Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "when that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' bout "you gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I'm matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime said you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for the boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy


Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance"
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the Clique Quad
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga

I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to ummm
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Yes I call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

Deceiving 
Deceiving 

Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

Deceiving 
Deceiving 

My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

Deceiving 
Deceiving 

Feel like uh
I feel like we back man 
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
What you mean I ain't call you?
I hit you when I landed
I'm waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we are arguing more and it's getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I f-cked you right I will
I f-cked you right I will
I'll fuck you like no-one has ever ever made you feel
I mean it's part of our relationships, amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real
You looking mad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves and me without no breaks
Ooh, I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
Uhh, and everytime I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It's useless all this fighting lets get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        

T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!

I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
Catch me at the hotel and try and get that cash
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call

Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different


We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different



When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else


Somebody remind me where I am
That's right Im at home, yeah Im right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So its on
I was looking for the one
Now Im feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now Im back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And Imma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You dont even know me
Imma do it all
Imma do it all
That's probably why Im back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tonight Im into breaking up
Somebodys home
Im drunk as ever
Im not alone, 
Im with my people
I know you love it
I dont just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You cant have my heart the doctor told me Id be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
Thats why Im steady yelling weatherman weatherman
Im about whatever man
Im tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But Im polite about it
Baby after you
Ive had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am


Tryna get the green like Im waiting at a long light
Broke just doesnt suit me girl and every night is prom night
Whered I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
Im the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, Ive been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
Im still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, Diddy



Uh, yeah, alright
Uh, well alright
Yeah, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Feel good

It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
And a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student
And her friend whose a model
Finished the whole bottle...
And we gonna do it big like this
Yea and he was just practice
He ain't in your world
You can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at
Maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
Yeah, and I got it together so when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself

This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

Silence keeps clouding me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

Yeah, stylin' though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin' dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yout when I was writin' Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin' the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' bis'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I Told You that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life

Don't you have a man? 
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? 
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything

Why you over there lookin at me
While your man standing right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
But you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly I'm kinda like
"I don't really wanna hit this girl"
And so she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'mma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...


Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON


Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone 
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like Gray's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do 
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", what?


I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, youre clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
Its like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am

'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it

Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners

You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations Imma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Ya'll record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here Imma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

Go play intramurals, brother, go play intramurals

When we hooked up years ago, you were supposed to come on the show, it didnt happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like youre gonna make history

Its been a while, thats kinda how we ended up here. When I got here , I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and Im watching this kid, its me but to me its just a kid thats just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think its been a long time since somebodys been able to sit down and do that with me, and thats how were here

Hows it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and its just grown. From there youve been non-stop, its crazy

Yeah that was an amazing time for all of us still doing it with the same people. It was just our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was 40 and Olivers apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from Money To Blow. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didnt.. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, I know he says hes over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen at that time people were like ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here
That was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like Stunt Hard and Forever was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldnt be what it is without them, thats Oliver and 40  you know its funny cos were sitting here talking and theyre back in Toronto executive producing More Life. Olivers executive producing it and 40 is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on So Far Gone so I was like man it would be nice to do something with me and you again, so I gave him that task and hes at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess well talk about

A lot to talk about  More Talk
Since were right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne.and he tells me  Yo hes been writing on Detox that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? Its taking it back

Its taking it back, Im not usually that good with the taking it back moments but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff  Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough thats like an area of our city. Id go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, theyd let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced  it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, man I need proof that you wrote this , so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax
You know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and 40, always brought 40 with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldnt move without 40, so brought 40. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said Man youre doing really good work and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money Id ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like we can get a hotel this is crazy, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque
So yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that 40 still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and 40, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path

So lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? Its a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to 

Yeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebodys watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with Work because Work came out before my album, and then progressed into One Dance, Controlla, Too Good. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that Id come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time Id make a song  40 is always really bluntly honest with me and was like Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive  and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that
So there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why Im here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess well get into More Life after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didnt celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasnt my biggest album by any means, it wasnt the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but Im very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that its had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people dont wanna say it

Did you know what you were doing when you made One Dance, Kylas on there, Wizkid is on there, its a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what youve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year

It really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because 

How did you discover it though, thats like a UK underground Funky Sound

I mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so Ive been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know its older than that, even just playing it and having people What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like Yo what was that song you just played? and I would be like man people really like that song but they dont know it. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, theres so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to 85 and I said to him like man if we could make a beat, I dont wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook, and he was like alright alright cool
I had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkids songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like Hotline Bling, I just didnt really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped Pop Style along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I dont know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know Im still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard One Dance and he just looked at me and hes like man thats gonna be the biggest song of your career to date and I was like cmon man its like, thats a lot to say, we hope it does well. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank yous to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it
I love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, thats the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because thats truly a classic song

With Pop style what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda werent on it?

Yeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and thats the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like man you know this is like Pop Style featuring the throne, this is huge and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didnt know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, its cool I like that, its a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know Im not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, Im not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I dont waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool Ill finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so Ill just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I dont really like you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I dont play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know

On the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?

I dont know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, Im not really sure what hes referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah Im not really sure, everybodys got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if thats what it is I dont really even understand the point youre trying to make but whatever it is that youre going through, I accept it, I dont respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, Im not sure why were the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what youre going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, thats kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs

So with Childs Play another banger, theres a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?

Oh you mean Im acting like Im light skin, that line , thats just sorta something people thats like very an American thing people say like ah man youre being light-skinned, I guess they say its like emotional you know. I just think its a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos Im actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah its just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke

When did you first experience racism, youre coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?

Man you know, Ive really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we dont live like that. Theres really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, its like a cultural mosaic. And I know Ive said that time and time again, but it truly is, its made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you dont ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I dont understand how it works or like your Canadian, youll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or youll never under.. That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time
You know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, its usually because Im not American to be honest with you, thats when I feel like people are against me or they feel like Im not part of the. I guess its got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else Im Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, Im a Black artist. Im apparently a rapper even though Hotline Bling is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a rap category, maybe because Ive rapped in the past, or because Im Black, I cant figure out why. Just like I cant figure out why One Dance wasnt nominated, maybe because they cant I mean, well its just theres pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and Im proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but youre right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that
And shout out and by the way Im speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I dont even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesnt feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or youre tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos its the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they dont decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said Im speaking from a winners point of view and Im so happy for him, Im not talking about.. Im not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in its own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, theyre.. Im Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just dont really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business
Yeah its a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know its a tough time and Im 

How did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammys were going on, you stuck to the tour..

Yeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me thats real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammys to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they dont air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man Im really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that weve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like Im really glad I stayed behind, I really dont wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said Blame It On Donald Trump  and Im not gonna say who it is that Im texting but this is like the institution, weve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all Im saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, thats OK too. Because you have to realise what institution youre dealing with. Youre dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and theyre either good people to the core or bad people to the core and well never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said Im speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, its just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what Im supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, thats just kinda how I feel about that about this given time

Inception is everything you're wanting
Just trust me
I'll take it easy on you, babe
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me, just trust me
I'll make it easy
Just trust me, girl
I'll take it easy

When I, um, I had rap, rap joints out there, and people were like, yeah he's nice, you know

It's hard to go from kid tv show to rapper

It is, it is, but you know, the more and more, we were consistent, it proved, it turned from a flaw to an attribute. You know, it's like, it makes the story better, I think at this point

Especially when the music is good and they're like, yo he's real

We started just putting songs out-

So are you aware, are you feeling this, this, this energy around you right now? There's people talkin' about you He knows, he knows, yeah like how does that feel, what does that feel like to you?

Every, every, like I said, I'm very humbled by it, I feel very blessed. And umm, yeah, I'm never gonna let it set in, I just wanna keep, I just wanna keep working to be honest with you

Ride the wave, baby, ride the wave. And you have some big interest too, like, I know you're working. There's one with Lil' Wayne, and you did, umm, just talk in the studio with some different people, can you talk about yet or no?

I've been working, I've been working all week with some of New York City's finest, umm, artists. I haven't been working with New York City's finest

Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me

I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and dont ever mean it, we go on dates
I send the Maybach out in neighbourhoods, they never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient
I ain't lying, yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia, some fly shit
Its sitting at the house like I bought in '96
Cause honestly Im too fucking busy to drive stick
I swear, too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasnt
Been hot before they open doors for me; pre-heated oven
Im in this so, but I ain't finished though
Its been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, Im the greatest my countrys ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga, of course

Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me

Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Cant tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB, these niggas make it so hard
To be friendly when I know part of its envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far these are empty
I take em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh, I never seen the car you claim to drive
Well, shit, I seen it, you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately it went from top 5 to remaining 5
My favorite rappers either lost it or ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down: me, Weezy and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then Ill probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me its like a high, and it wasn't a lie
Yeah, just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga

Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Dont fuck with me, don't fuck with me

Yeah, look

Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

I'ma tell you like this, nigga

I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Bitch I'm eatin' lavish, look up, ho, it's snowin' now
I just throw the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League gon' hold it down
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

Alright my patience runnin' thin
Olympic pools of money, I'm just glad I learned to swim
Cannonball, bitch, I hope your diving board's sturdy
And I hope when dinner's cold, my niggas do not desert me
Nah, but shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And these haters pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person, man I wish y'all would
I say you lucky if your father was a figure
Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger
I took time to load the bullets, now I'm 'bout to pull the trigger
Like boom, boom, boom, I'm a genius, god dammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other lames is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
But you can tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feelin' like

Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me
I hear everybody talkin' 'bout what they gon' be
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon see
I got money in the courts 'til all my niggas are free
'Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be
I hear fairy tales bout how they gon run up on me
Well, run up when you see me, then, and we gon see

They tryna take the wave from a nigga

I love this man. 
Meant just.. just ready? cause I ain't actually goin do it till ya ready 
Hoee
Verse 1
Cause i've never had a Benz-o
Nope or push me a act with the tints-o
Noizy Niggas speakin in my Window
Have a hard time luckin
I tell you second hand its a hard grind cookin
...

Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess that's what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rapper's life. You know what I'm saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, I'mma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope I'm on key, hahaha

The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And both them record deals that ain't ever go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you don't get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that

I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper

Oh man... Yo V-O man let's reminisce for a second man, we been through a lot of shit man. Like um, you remember when, you remember when you used to kick it at Jazzy's studio yo? And you used to make fun of Rahmel and say that he looked so old that if you punched him in the face, his head might turn to dust yo. I remember that, and you used to make of Diggs too man and now you like, standing side by side with him cuttin' records, I think that shit funny man. Ayo Boi-1da you remember the time he told us about um, knockin' some dude out back in uh, what was it college, university man, but really, he got his ass laid out and had to call D10 to come fix him up . Oh man. let's get back into the track

Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey
Cause everyone you get around got you gas money
And where the cash at? Nigga speakin' of gas money
We all had to give you lifts, isn't that funny?
It's real talk, you know better I don't play that
He told you I'mma liar, I figured that he would say that
But this the same nigga that be talkin' about a Maybach
And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax

Dawg, I mean, you just shit on everybody, b. And that's ya problem man, I'm about loyalty man. I mean, I remember when you told me that D10 better pull his act together or else he gon' be babysittin' ya kids man, damn! You done shit on Sho, Me, Symphony, Andreena, Carmen, Lanny, Jazzy, Promise. Man, you done made fun of everybody over at Maxamus Melanie, Taj, Rahmel, Diggs. You said you was gonna knock ex out. You even made fun of Boi-1da when I wasn't around. I mean dog, you, you just a unloyal cat man  and this the commitment right here, Heartfelt music, ho! Ya man Toronto I got you for the next two summers don't even worry man. Yeah, shout out to everybody I know, everybody that's down with me that know that they down with me man. Precise waddup, Jason Johnson waddup, Niko waddup, Janyelle I see you baby and I know you seeing Niko, hahah


Yeah. Ho!
It's Drake. Uh Uh. Ho!
Do that dance. Do that Dance

You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
 

I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
Jason tell me I'mma have a baby by next year
Psychic told me I'mma have three kids
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
 
 
Believe me baby, Stevie baby
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So do that dance, do that dance
Go head girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh

Yeah because you special baby
Yeah this the remix right here
Yeah Trendsetters
Drake, It's Southern Smoke

Please

D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down  I'm gettin ahead 
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead 
I'm lucky I ain't dead  I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded

I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded

Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
Cause they feel like they know me 
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed 
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game 
This ain't no motherfucking ninety-one
We out here rapping for money, you niggas rapping for fun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun


You would think it's all mine the way I took it
You would think it broke down the way I push it
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar

Let's do the things that we say on text
I want to get straight to the climax 
Have you coming all summer like a season pass
I want to turn you out like pitch black

I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
I know that you know, that you know, you know that's it's true
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

I know you been working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just trying to be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order

And before you leave here 
And until you do babe 
Ain't about me no more 
Tonight I'll make sure 
And before you leave here 
But before you do 
It ain't about me no more 
Make that sure you 
Part 2: Make Sure

Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the  rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now 
Girl it makes so much sense now 
You know that I'm gon' make sure now 
Make sure, make sure  
Make sure, make sure 
Make sure, make sure 
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure 
Make sure, make sure  
The first time I saw you
I thought you were barefoot
Your hair was pulled back, your jelly shoes, I was wondering if I should
Lie
About my age
Buddy Holly glasses on a Betty Page negative
You're looking so classic handpicked by some Hollywood executive
Just like Norma Jean
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Way oh
Way oh
Way oh
The next time I saw you, you asked for a reason
I let my love come down
Now you're spending all your time thinking how you're gonna get even
And I'm by myself
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
Good morning now
It's a good morning
The Hollywood ending it never came easy
The bride to be can plainly see and now she says she's ready to kill me
And I'm so afraid
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you
I can't believe I've fallen for you

Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do 
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

I swear I always fall for your type 
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type 
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all 
I believe in people like you

Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before


Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl Im wit' it
Ive been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and its the first impression
And I heard theres nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man its been a while and I swear that this one's different
Thats why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And Im slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And Im just trying to correct it, and I fall

Take you back
Take you back
That was such a lie
Every time you said you loved me, you can't look me in my eyes
And I beg you for the truth, so much goin' thru my mind
And my father did just pass, to make my problems multiply
And I know nobody's perfect, but you finally crossed the line
And I gave you everything, but you was never satisfied
And you said I was the one, just like you told another five
Feel like it's a competition against all these other guys
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Every time I see you, feels like time is moving slow
It's unfortunate for me, I have some trouble letting go
Even though it's in the past, I just felt like you should know
And you hate me when I get high, but you're the reason that I smoke
Girl quit playin'
Girl quit playin'
You ain't love me from the start
You're the reason that I feel this way
You broke my fuckin' heart
And I gave you all my trust, but you just tore it all apart
Now you're all I think about while I'm layin' in the dark
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Been a couple months and you're beggin' for me back
And I love all the attention, I'm not sure how I should act
And you're saying that you miss me, I refuse to say it back
Even though I still do want you, I don't have the time for that
Cause these women stay the same, while this nigga's chasin' cash
And your problems are so small, girl just trust me they ain't bad
Cause you cryin' bout a nigga while I'm cryin' bout my dad
And its eating me alive, should've taken me instead
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night, it's been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you dont do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself youre the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh youre my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well, arent you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Like "voil!" You do it right he might just buy you a car
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say Im buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Naked ring finger, M3 Beamer
Champagne Range, Triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti

Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go 
Go, go, go, go, go 

Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well well spend it together
Im down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

Oh, you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy huh?

Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking damn where did they go
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
And now I see em picking up the pieces
One too many starting over speeches
I guess its back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note Im trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
Used to sit back and say I know Ill get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, its whatever
You know
Feeling good
Living better
But its evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I been here before, huh?
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright


Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big

You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number

But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together


She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl ?
For some gucci huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me


Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands

The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it


This is why I do this shit
I think they call this, venting

Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me


I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open


Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything


I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say


I'm more than just an option 
Refuse to be forgotten 
I took a chance with my heart, 
And I feel it taking over

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number 
I doubt you'll find another 
So every single summer 
I'll be the one that you'll remember and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission 
You hear, but you don't listen 
You better pay attention 
And get what you've been missing

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private 
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you

Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off likeOh

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good
All in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off likeOh

Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off likeOh
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown: Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled: chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money; Benjamin Button "What?" nothin'
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world, like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me, when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me  no, you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class: Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top!"
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go; Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind itpay back, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call

Weezy F Baby, always lookin' like I've done some shit
You ain't know nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I kill you and who you comin' with
No , T I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no bootsy
Hounds Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
The Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24s boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without that grey coupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood motherfucker, a blood motherfucker
Forever like E T C period motherfucker

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call

I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
'Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga this that crack, and you know drugs cost so P A Y U P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me, never L I E
I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
You heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah nigga, me too
'Cause take my mind off the pressure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-Doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that Tanner?

But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man

I want this shit forever man

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches


Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button  nothin' man
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back


Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh


There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
So Drake


Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Youll see new heights youll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!

Dom Ros toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you

Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!

Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die

Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!
Free shmoke, free shmoke, ayy!

Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real

Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk, you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back
So I'm all in with these new flows
New flows got new flows
Rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and screw flows
My shit is sounding like grey tapes
Let me go on and hit that cup
One time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast
So give me anything to make shit go slow
Money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no

Tat my name on you so I know it's real

I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
Simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap dance to my drum roll
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled

I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you, there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up with some old shit to drivers opening doors
This is my town if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours
If you ask for it, it's done
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
You'll meet everybody I know
First it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role
Put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side

I just give everybody a piece of this and make due with what's left

Southside banging it so I chop and screw it
Futon flow watch this shit unfold, Rap so i'll like a common cold
I don't give a fuck where you where told, I'm getting that money acupula gold
I'm smoking that kush so sweets in the air, She looking back at me when I'm pulling her hair
I'm a ball, Never fall, your girl is on the call, Begging me to scoup her up
So I can pin her on the wall
We ridding in the coop 2 seat bucket, Hit it when I'm smoking and driving fuck it
That's how I'm a do it with your ass on the steering wheel
Smoke another blunt pop another happy feeling pill
Snatching off braws, you can feel the crush
When it flows, threw your nose, you can feel the rush

Tat my name on you so I know it's real

Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' 

I got friends with money, and I got money too

Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
I tend to dro puff
I'm throwed and I'm high
I guess I'm throwed up
Tone it all down
My nigga grow up
And tell me when you start getting paid to show up, damn

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."


Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know


Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

Hello
I've been hurt so many times
It got to a point
When I decided
I can't do this anymore
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
I need someone that loves me

You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to

You need me to

You know, we don't have to be dramatic
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
As your woman
Give me a kiss goodnight
Over the phone
When you're working late
When you're out of town
Tell me how much you need this
'Cause we deserve it
We can be together, but

You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to 
You need me to 
You need me to

Dun know already, cuz
Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote
Money is everythang, and its every other thing
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain
It's comin too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin
It's on meee, everything is on meee
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. DRAKE!
Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please.. wine crackers and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my t's
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese
My watch make the frickin' time freeze
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch...
Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right?
Wayne: Dedication threeee

Yeahhh
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uhh
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh

Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it

DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie
Yeah
I'm serious man, please, just get over it
Just for y'all I'mma keep it humble as a mumble in the jungle
Y'know what I'm talkin' bout
It's Drizzy
Thank Me Later coming soon
Just lemme live man
It's all I ask
Here I go
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!


When you're out of town, tell me how much you need cause
...No...
Good night over the phone when you working late
When you're out of town tell me how much you need
Cause who you are, with me, together

You need me to get that shit together
You need me to
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You need me to get that shit together
You need me to get that shit together

Look, I know girls love Beyonc
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you aint no different
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
Ive been avoiding commitment
Thats why Im in this position
Im scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me, but I am not alone
But if youre alone then, say my name, say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you aint running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
Cause those other men are practice
And this aint no time for actin
And this aint no time for games
And this aint no time for uncertainty
And this aint no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin some shit when Im in the zone
This is why Ive been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
Im just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone thatll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we dont wanna hide no more
Plus youre not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, Im not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, Baby, I love you
If you aint running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Look... I know girls love Beyonc, girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you aint no different
These days its hard to meet women, feel like my love life is finished
Ive been avoiding commitment that's why Im in this position
Im scared to let somebody in on this, +No New Friends+, no no no
You know how this shit go, you got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me, but I am not alone
But if youre alone then, say my name, say my name

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say, Baby, I love you
If you aint running games, say my name, say my name
You actin kinda shady, baby, why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

Look, I know girls love Rihanna, girls love to play with your mindset
Girls always find out the business, and baby you ain't no different
I think I've met a few women, who know the meaning of winning
So I'mma take on
And leave here, cause girl we don't have to be here
I'm 'bout to let somebody
In on this, old friend, she is new friends
She knows me from way back when I
Know she knows my ways
The way I was from way back then, these people won't believe the years
We've spent before as friends, now we're together she can say


Yeah, uh... Say my name, say my name, cause those other men are practice
And this aint no time for actin, and this aint no time for games
And this aint no time for uncertainty, and this aint no time for locking your phone
And not coming home and startin some shit when Im in the zone
This is why Ive been saying, "no new friends, no no no"
You know how this shit goes, this is not four years ago
Time escapes me, now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying, Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
Im just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone thatll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with cause we dont wanna hide no more
Plus youre not shy no more; neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, Im not alone, even though +Nothing Was The Same+
Let me get your ass alone, let me make you say my name, say my name


Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best

When I give ya what I give ya

When I give ya what I give ya

It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya

When I give ya what I give ya

It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that 
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that 
And when I give ya what I give ya


Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight with no cubes
Take me where the women be
I won't lose
Drake take Patrn to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena
I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya


Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

 Watch out
Why, nigga?  cops out
 Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom, now we here now

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

We about to get the whole nine
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof

Watch out for me, I'm about to glow

I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go

Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow

Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
You need devotion
Can I hear right on?
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
I said it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!


for me
Dont pull up at 6AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you loving on me
I dont wanna die for them to miss me
Guess I see the things that they wishing on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story shit was different with me
God's plan, ya'lls playin
I hold back, sometimes I won't 
I feel good, sometimes I don't 
I finessed down Weston Road 
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store clothes
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currencys imported
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if they're were acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say hes a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal memeber
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen''til I mention I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
They condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life
I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo'
Converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga

Summer's mine
I swear I said about a hundred times, I'm gonna need it back
I wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl I needed that from you
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
I'm spending time just taking care of me right now
I'm getting money just taking care of me, girl
Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

Don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you're starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows

But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got SARS, you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
Why you tryna get in where I'm tryna get out
Why won't you just be yourself, why won't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You just a fantasy, family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' a bitch, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove

Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we callng y'all tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard

Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, storytellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good

See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name 
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I dont get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Evertime I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas 
G-35, x5 nah niggas 
This here is a public announcement for my niggas 
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas

I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And naw this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you shoulda seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then i'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?

Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat 
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity 
Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma 
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea 
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign 
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant 
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free 
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" 
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school 
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you 
With what I spend in a weekend I could aquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!

You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
Get over it, get over it
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth

I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me

And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look

Tell me how you really feel
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Couldn't make a greatest hits
Y'all a whole lot of things
But you still ain't this
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard you never claimed the hood
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Oh well, ship sailed
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
We done really put some days in

Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up

They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy

Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out

They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Uh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if Im with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga

I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
Its more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
Im at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!

Herms link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

Yeah, October Firm in the cut
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
She wanna get married tonight
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back

Herms link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my

I'm so hot, yeah, Im so right now
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I gotta do mansion 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

Herms link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga

She says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when youre fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
Its all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, dont I?
I get off topic dont I? I get it poppin dont I?
Ill end up stopping wont I? And by the time I end up stopping
Youll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga dont lie
Shes losing it right now, cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So shes here and we're both so gone

Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So shes here and we're both so gone


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that youve broken and ties that youve severed
No doubt in my mind, thatll make them feel better
Verse 1
Why do u even try this shit, why do I even give a fuck, I gotta lot of confidence and I don't try to suck, it's the rap game nigga, u laying like a boba fett, nigga I've set the dice, but I'll have to pay the price
I'll just get out the cross
Yeah I believe in that
I would never punch a chick
Just to get to that
I'm the one who never snitched
Yeah I'm a guy like that
All u do is snitch and bitch
I don't believe in that
I eat all the food off the plate, cuz Im eating like that
But u won't cuz I'm the best
All u do is cry like that
Oh,oh, don't do it, please don't do it
I abuse my power, so please don't kill me,Blake got the money, so Blake gonna pay it, those all my niggas, so I don't even need  to say it cuz they know. I'm done
Just the first verse

Yea, Ha! Ok well
I suppose it's safe to say, this is the end for you
And the beginning for me

I'm a real nigga, nothing artificial
I run with former drug dealers and they all official
I know you soft as tissue, so ain't no arguing wit you
Say its all fun and games 'til them bottles hit you
Get ya issue if you wanna I don't play it dawg
You don't wanna see them killers wit the K's dawg
Zone One Westside of the A dawg 
U thinkin we some suckas you was way off
I ball all night, go hard all day
Balls deep up in your broad all day
T.I. not fly that's all yall say
Big bankrolls and massage all day

Outta Hollywood in my Denali
Aye, flawless bodies, gorgeous faces
Safe to say they goin places
Great head, wet pussy touchin bust or base
Aye shawty goin in, won't ever go away
And all that goin ape shit
Ain't no need to tell em they know!

They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

I be yelling out money over everything
Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake
Girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like "why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact
That it's true
Listening to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers
All these niggas sound like "All My Children"
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know


I be yelling out:
Money over everything
Money on my mind
Tell them I apologize
It happened over time, they know

All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
All the niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'

She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

What are we even doing?

Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm not used to settlin' down
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him"
And I say "well, goddamn"

Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment

Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city


Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas 
Houstatlantavegas  Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision
Been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers
Out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you?
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My heart belongs to you...

Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then

But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now?
Cause I'm up right now, and you stuck right now, yeah
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

My hearts belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do


So hard to breathe this air that we call love
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love
When you get hurt by the one you living for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can?t be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince you love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I?m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothing I?m afraid to say
Oooooohhh

I?ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is trying to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now its changed
My life ain't the same as you are
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can?t have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried
But all for nothing I?m afraid to say


Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I?ve drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there?s pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that?s sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you?re suspicious I?m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that?s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I?m gone do
Since everything I?m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I?m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we?ll be for sure

Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can?t be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself



Gotta do what I gotta do

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me, I'm just done in the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I pull up on you in that purple thing bumpin' Purple Rain
Singin' "Purple Rain," sippin' purple rain
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
You ain't flame gang, you ain't same gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
It's a different world, it's Dewayne Wayne, oh Lord
Okay now we got some action
Fucking models out of Maxim
I'm too wavy, I'm what's happening
Okay now we got some rapids
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Smokin' cookies, sippin' Acti
Okay now we got some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank her for takin' my breath from me
But the second me gon' be the better me
J.R. Smith with the shot
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
I call my AK Barney
And I'ma let this baby pop
Pull up on you like Steph Curry
With my foot up on you like F worries
Been outchea since Keith Murray
Codeine got me with pink urine
So you know I don't have the energy
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My exes wanna be friends with my other exes
And I don't have the sympathy

Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Slatt, slatt, slatt 
Jeffery

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 

Look, I want you to myself
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he did a number on you 
That must be why you move so, icy
Icy like 1017
Icy like there's nobody youd ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me 
Patient as can be, but

I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone
Before you end up like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 

I wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there 
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera 
See you when I see the real thing 
Gettin' realer and realer, yeah, yeah, yeah
But you icy like 1017 
Icy like there's nobody you'd ever need 
Better not give that up 
I'm here patient as can be, man

I still need some satisfaction
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything somehow

Feelin' rough, rough
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to give it up to someone
You need to give love to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
You need to give it up to someone

Jeffery 
Jeffery
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah 
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away
I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this one's special
So I make sure that my suit'll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85
I'm too legit
I'm just trying to get her in the mood
And have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the house

Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
And these haters pretending that it's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like

I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie 
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
The house looks something like a resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler 
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up

I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie

Album Art:

Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I gotta email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely too

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you, I get lonely

I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you
Boy Wonder
And C-O-S-S-O-M
 - Kevin Cossom
I get money, I get paper
I get girls, all different flavors
I buy Gucci, I buy Prada
I spend dollar after dollar 
 - Drake
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sittin' right inside the pocket of my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this sh*t, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records
All of you seein' ghosts
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm gettin' rich, all of you stayin' broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose-down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up
But there is no one my size
Whatever Forty smokin' 'bout to lower my eyes
Beast mode on 'em
I never take a night off
Every single thing a n***a purchase is a write-off
Grounded as the runway pavement
I'm takin' flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off

 - Kevin Cossom
 - Kevin Cossom
And I'm the rookie of the year
I'm 'bout to get my dough on
I'm about to take off
Baby you should hold on
But I ain't about to prolong
I'ma keep it short
And tell you what's about to go on
Bottle after bottle
'Cause the money's, like, so long
Biggest movie ever
We about to put a show on
I'ma show off, like I'm supposed to
You can get lost, I don't know you
 - Drake
I hear my phone ringin' when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm, hmm, hmm, I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest
I'ma knock him out his place
Call me "Homicide Drizzy"
I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole-dances in the zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And, yeah, my G-Pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, the stylist would agree
Wavin' at your girl while she's smilin' back at me
 - Kevin Cossom
 - Kevin Cossom
Louie, too
Yeah, and Alexander McQueen
I'm so clean, so mean
It's K.C. and Drizzy
And it's the remix, remix
C-O-S-S-O-M


Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, ros and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing them shows
Getting everyone nervous, cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm going off, like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go

And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy, like it's retarded
Red light on it, like it's recording
I ain't recording, I'm just C-4ing
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm going get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! Then you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches, like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screaming, motherfucker, do you hear her?
Drizzy Drake what the lick read
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        

Yeah
Uh huh
Um, uh huh
Okay

Hello mothafucka, hey hi how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby come to take a shit and urine
On the toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you living, kill you in the kitchen
The feds trying to clip us but we ain't even tripping

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowing purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though: I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in and bucking when the hook drop

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

Hold up, wait one motherfucking minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfucking lieutenants
If I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfucking meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfucking spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfucking in it
No need for a room, yea you know I'm fucking in it
She acting like she not, but she know she fucking winning
She said, "I seen it all", I said, "no you fucking didn't"
You ever bust 10 nuts in a 2-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt end
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yea I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothing like them
I'm goin' in!

I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard


The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say

They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Baby I just landed
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
And I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way 

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Nothin on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please



Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about

 I-I, I'm ready for ya

Artist: Drake

Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So I threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work, I'll be right here in the same bed
That you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the us Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it
Yeah, when lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if I can hit it in the morning

And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
Baby can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

Hey,  God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldn't judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can
Do somethin
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cooking nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my way and you think about me all day, that's just a warning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
Can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom
After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm... what you got?
Comeback

Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration

From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smalls, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in nigga
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?
I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on
Girl, when I get you to the crib

Upstairs to the bed

Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher

I got a confession

Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing

Girl, can we take it up stairs

My bed's waitin' there

All I want to do is

Is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now

You know I live a magnum lifestyle

Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on
Girl, when I get you to the crib

Upstairs to the bed

Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets

And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex
It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself
Girl, when I get you to the crib

Upstairs to the bed

Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
 Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
He a star now look up you'll probably see him
Hook
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm Still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
S550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I'm fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky

26 on my third GQ cover
Your new shit sound like you do covers
On all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they're winning
On some coach shit, 50Ms for a three month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'mma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

But thats thats where all this.. thats where the feeling is
Thats where all that shit comes from man I mean like
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang..
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD

Your money is just a little Barneys Co Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best emcee
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
I comedy central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
That five star in your city, they know where we at
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga

Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga

Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back

Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Feel naked cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you niggas is autistic, retarded
Started, hold your applause
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for twelve hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less to me
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back

When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em

Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah

When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know, they'll know

And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?


Boi-1da... Drizzy

Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go

I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

Rock me real slowly
Rock me real slowly
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you

Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home
Warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose

It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time 
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Anytime people want to start problems
It's like for real, are you dumb?
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh

It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong

So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barely remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
So I kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Coast
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Kick, push
Coast
Peep the way I roll
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick
Then push
And coast

Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh

Feeling sorry for the runner up
Im still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesnt put the numbers up
Man, hate is so pass, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and its just me and my money
Ya dont even get to play when yall leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now Im high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit

Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three

You don't know nothin' 'bout me
Life for my bruddas is deep
Long as they all on they feet
Long as they pockets is greaze 
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet 
Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep 
Taller in person, you'll see when we meet

Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Spen jumped out the Ghost in a suit, lookin' all churchy 
Fingers all itchin', twitchin', lookin' all jerky 
Whippin' that white girl , cookin' that Cersei 
I was pushin' that dark shit, pushin' that charcoal 
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo 
Look at them jokers, look at that arsehole
Man are gettin' bread now, and this is that hard dough 
Clap man, dominant murder

Could've just slapped man, but he wanted it further 
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

Give me a kiss and I'll throw one back baby
You know it's that kush

Smelling right.. kush, smelling right


When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack

6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in

They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack

When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realist one that's rappin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they made me down the rest, I know I was always rappin
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been ma greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessings

Didn't recognize a king when he rappin with you
You always suck it like you always bring a vacuum with you
Sounded like a man that canpachine plastic gives you
Cause if you got up on a pick, I got imagine issue

Talking about me then it got a be lies
Cause I never get a tag or a chance to reply
If you don't got the courage to answer me
Then you could fuck yourself, but you would fall until the battery dies
I mean you're mad at me why? Cause I had to be fly
Two albums in a year and I can't even try
Tried to fill my shoes that you had to re size
I'm the king, I'm the throne, bitches where I was at

When I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back
I'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat
If I die, all I know I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's so great for my city, I'm the realist one that's rappin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
When they made me down the rest, I know I was always rappin
Oh my God, my whole life, my words been ma greatest weapon
I know I. I know I, been the cos greatest blessings

Uh, when did you get like this?
Least you coulda done
Is gone and give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there
When you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me

Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before?
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

Look, leave me, leave me, I can't fucking stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we 'posed to be together 'til the world end
But, I don't really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call, you just tell me how I don't call you
Why you do thatdo that, do thatyeah

Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: "Nobody's workin' as hard as you."
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probly true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
But I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park, stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
And I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
That's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gonna tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

Oww, hoes turn they heads like owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flowin', I'm connected to a higher power
Bright lights will make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when I'm in the night club
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight 'cause the satellite was crispy
Y'all can miss me with the money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
Uh, I don't do too much bloggin'
I just run the town, I don't do too much joggin'
I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here's how they gon' come at you
With silly rap feuds, tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini meet, watch for the traitors
I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dum-dums could done him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let them tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as the Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would have went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas! Bitches, too!
All I got is this money  this will do

Who would've thought I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast and get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down I'ma make it go

Hate is temporary
Love is necessary
I went from eating pussy to eating commissary
Damn, I am the sickest, I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you cant afford to question me
First off I dont need you second guessing me
Jail is like third base: Im coming home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Man I'm anemic: still got blood
Im in my cell reading fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sipping Amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I cant smell
Man they did me wrong; I feel like Nelson Mandel
I shine too hard my lamp fell
My name still ringing: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn, cause you know damn well
That I still got you open, open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane youre on that double-park shit
We eating at the top, get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
Id be sober if gift was a fifth
Im feeling like Elvis  jailhouse rock
Im not 2Pac, Im the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars dont stop recording over the phone
I hope the call dont drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball wont drop
And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops
Young Money get em, Young Money got em
The boss got his feet up, vacation on an island
Yeah and tell your girls send the kite up
And even if you dont smoke motherfucker you gon have to light up

Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know, who I was before you
And basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind

Oh, but maybe in time 
I'll tell you I'm

A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff, cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I

I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh, welltell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably

A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you

Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I dont know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, Im 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but Im just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Dont I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
Im never tripping over anything that ain't mine
Im hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Its been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
And the kids wearing crowns over here and everything is alright


Its like 09 in your basement
And Im in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasnt ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me Im just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your sonman, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cus when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad storyblack American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then youd toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talkand he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in thisin this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that. So God bless you, and I hope I'll see you...


And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me 
And I know the sun will rise with me
All we wanted was an opportunity
 Lord knows!

It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real 
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real 
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping 
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy 
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things 
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal


I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great

I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. 

No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child thats takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
Thats not respectable all of a sudden?
I dont get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone, with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

This is the 6s year
Six hundreds instead of six, OVO
You know well be rockin' our asses out
To my big brother Drizzy
You know what Im sayin'?
More Life, 6 to the world, gang shit

Damn, another 20 missed calls
I love her and I hate her
It's a funny twist y'all
Can't stand her it when she in town
But miss her when she gone
Truth be told
I'd rather be with her than alone
But fights break out
And neighbors call 5-0
Screamin you the most foul bitch I know!
Forever mine wherever I go
Sex pistols out  die slow
Nah die slower than that
Just co-llapse all over my matt-ressss
Who shot cha that nigga ain't finished
So once again I find myself in it 
Just let me take a minute
Round 2 is in the chamber
All you gotta do is spin it
Aim for the heart
Battle of the sexes
All's fair love and war casualties expected

I'm tryna do it all, tonight
I got plans, I got a certain lust, for life
And as it stands, everything is going as right
As it can; they tryna shoot down my flight
Before it lands...before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say 
My ex sendin' late night text
Cause she don't know how to let 
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin in the coldah yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all... in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Every time... that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh...and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past
It's funny when you comin in first
But you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

Throw your ones up in the aiiir
Throw your ones up in the air for her, ooh-oh
Throw your ones up, in the air
Throw your ones up
Drake
Yeah, alright uh uh
Uh, Low key peter parker flow
Tell her bring some ace of spades, no sparklers though
Private flights, no hassle I just park and go
Im the highlight, like when markers glow
Ooo look what you created, only got yourself the blame
I remember when you hated, ooo
Now you tell me take my time
How bout' I just take your city make that mother f*cker mine
Uh huh
Ima underground king hoe
I sit tall, I swing low
The game ain't always fair, and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out, everyone don't get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo, that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain't never answerin
You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties, where you stuck outside and can't get in
Call me ron burgundy, yall the other anchormen
What's on the news trick, gossipin bout music?
There's rumors im the new shit, and guess what its true bitch

Chorus
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
Its so amazing
You wouldve thought we made it up
Hook  
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine
Big Sean
Uh, Yeah, Aye Look
I need less friends, more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts, now I get escorted 
I'm just waitin on my cue dog, no pledge
Says she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw her on my track team
Handed my baton to her
Passed her, blew her off
I chronic veronica
Who got up on my nurse, so I had to platonic her
Nah that ain't my girl but every leader needs a monica
I'm the head of my state, ain't that ironica 
I want the baddest chick, to treat my stick like a thermometer
Oh, I'm who they goin ape shit over
I'm who your girlfriend acting, like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas, but business broads
See business equals money, and money's over all
I'm tryna move momma, from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can't stay in that fuckin' hood forever 
We was made for that mick jagger shit, bag a chick, and a chick
Fast girls, faster whips, big chains, master shit
Bitch I'm livin every day, month, yearly
Yellin till you mother f*ckers hear me 
I made it!
Chorus 
Feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
Its so amazing, You wouldve thought we made it up
Hook 
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess, he knows it
Anointed and protected, I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

People change, I'm not surprised
Devil's working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It won't work, they all have tried

I seen man turn fool for the money
One too many times
I seen some girls turn their back
On their best friend from time
I heard you say things that you can't take back, girl, no time
I need you to go easy now and fix up one time

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows I'm trying
God knows I'm trying for you
God knows I'm trying

You put food on the table for me, aye?
Alright, fam, soft. I see you, aye?
You pay my bills, right?
It's light
You're a wasteman
Top story
Wah?


Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

Plan this shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone
So they'll never know
But I might tell you one day you never know
We'll see how I feel, we'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry about doing your hair
Or what you should wear
This not a video shoot I don't care, don't over prepare
Got to remind me again where you stay
Even though I think know the way but, you know, just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you in ten just be ready to go
Spending shit out on my own, the way it should go
Wrote it in code then wrote it in stone, so they'll never know
But I might tell you one day, you never know
We'll see how I feel
We'll see if you hold up your end of the deal
For now let me handle the wheel and don't worry 'bout doing your hair
Or what you should wear, this not a video shoot, I don't care
Don't over prepare
Gotta remind me again where you stay
Even though I think I know the way, but just in case I miss the road
Pulling up on you, j-just be ready to go

I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, itll make the shit last
Dont make it too easy, girl, dont take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and youve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe its just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you dont love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
That's why youre bad as fuck and you

B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches Im badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when Im straddling
And my shits so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
Its Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, Im the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
Its MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, Im dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause Im fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
Ill give it all away, dont care what the people say
Ill be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag
Im a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if Im guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing, girl, all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
And I know all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
And I know all I can say is
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  I'm so
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Im so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
Everythings adding up, youve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience

To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz

I'm from the city where people be gettin lazy
Litterin in the streets
And the club district is poppin like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers
Money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams
And dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events
Bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot
So girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
Daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane
And she back where she was
Right back on the bus
Its a shame cause now at his window
She throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
You can see thats shes colder
Cuz he doesnt hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her
That he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say


Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through
Chances are that it ain't you
I singlehandedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out 
Whenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background witcha asses shakin
Hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
I ask you to have some patience

To my dudes in the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin cigars in the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya are part of the speech coz

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, Im the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we dont need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
Thats why Im ready man
Id never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
Im going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didnt see yall
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch round me
Cause, aint no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, aint no nigga like me
Ya dig

I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If Im with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you aint heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They aint really got a choice, its an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, its a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I aint acting like Im rude
Im just acting like Im rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I dont waste time, cant you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezys fucking crazy

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch round me
Cause, aint no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, aint no nigga like me

I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious

Cups of the ros
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway, and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around


I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."


I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You're not gonna come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "You niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that
I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble
We gonna be in some trouble, trouble

I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
She could be good for me yeahh
That's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin' in my face, somethin had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Ohhh

Ooh, I hate the shit you do

I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars
I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would of cared more
Thats my only feeling inside when ever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now its like a shock to my pride
I dont care if she know
Cuz thats basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus

I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house
Do you got somebody new in your life
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with, why can't I get over it
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop missing you,  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you NO NO NO NO
I can't stop missing you,  wish I was still with you 
I can't stop missing you, NO, NO, NO, NO

Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away
I want you to know its been hell tryna do this with out you here
Baby 07' supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
In every girl I try to replace
You with, why can't I get over it
Simply 'cause I can't

I can't stop missing you,  wish I was still with you

I said "Tell me what's really going on?"
"Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?"
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
 Yeah, I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge herbut I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for "Do Right And Kill Everything"
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rolling
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on...

Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ughhh, that's nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lying in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't tripping, I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zo?
Weezy F Baby and the "F" is for "front door"
Cause that's where I bring it, soo-woo if you banging, motherfucker

Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boyH-Town!
Im gone, Im gone, Im gone
Im gone, Im gone, when Im gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when Im gone
Miss me a little when Im gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Same four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me

Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's  team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should band rubber

I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Same four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me

These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his GOB, it's like...

I take time to make that 
Some breakdowns get caked back 
Flip eight times, get eight stacks 
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's no need to stash right 
Same four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me


Southern Smoke
It's Southern Smoke baby!
 Frank Dukes
 My man Nickelus F
 Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
 This is the remix right here
 So if you got some 
Put ya hands in the air
 Southern Smoke

Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
 Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

I, take time arrange that 
Some, kill just to claim that 
Switch countries exchange that 
You cannot get jack for freeee
And my, proceeds and cash right 
There's, no need to stash right 
Got the same, four G's from last night 
You cannot take that from me, homie

Moneys the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benzs comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind
Ill blow your mind all over the money thats on your mind
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga!

I am on twenty four hours champange diet spilling while I'm sipping I encourage you to try it I'm probably just saying that cause I don't have to buy it the club wanna supply it boy I'm on that fly shit boy I am what everyone in my past don't want me to be guess what I made it I'm the moderfucking man I just want you to see come take a look get a load of this nigga quit fronting on me don't come around and try to gass me up I like running on E I I I I'm on my busy shit busy flow own records I'm caping hooking my new car is rothy yo damn where my ritches go I'm somebody that you should know get the shaking something cause that's what drama pro usually for yes I make mistake that I don't ever make excuses for like even girls they love me and constantly cedusing hoes I'm losing my thoughts I said damn where my ritches go top slip off like janet at the studio

Me and stunna in it, boy I'm just so connected
Caught up in a popularity contest
It's about to reach my dreams and I ain't even got my arms stretched
Thank me later first week I'm taking all bets
Because a million copies isn't really far fetched
I keep credit cards in cash knots
I keep my darkest shades on til the flash stops
It's for my LA girls getting them implants
And all my DC girls getting them ass shots
Got em for a reason shortie, go ahead buss it open
I keep a secret baby, nothings heard when nothings spoken
Haters talk it like my buzz isn't enough promotion
And I just lost a Gucci sandal in the fucking ocean
Damn, I guess the problems of a teen star
Are confused all the conversations between y'all
And dog that's funny, pay me what you know nigga
All cash money

I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon, I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote Take Care, but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything's a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, juss know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low

Coming Soon

It's uhm, it's great to be back on SNL
Where's Toronto at? Is Toronto in the house tonight? Yeah
So...as you can tell I'm from Canada
And I know what you're thinking, but... no
You can not move in with me if Trump wins
I'm sorry, that's no go
I really am glad to be here but you'll ha...you'll have to excuse me if I seem a little upset
Backstage, right before I came out
My friend showed me this...meme he found online
And it just...it really shook me
It was a picture of me dancing in my Hotline Bling video
And some joker...had put a caption on it that said
"When you farted and got away with it"
And if I'm being real, like...it hurts, you know...and it...
It just seems like this keeps happening to me
And I don't know...It's almost like I can do is sing about it
So...I'm ready

Drinks with some old friends
That's when it happens again
I start hearing from the whole fam
That I got clowned on Instagram
Tryna hide my reaction
When I read the funny caption
Feels like I'm in a bad dream
Cause I got turned into another meme, yeah

I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme, that's right
I just wanna scream
That I'm more than a meme

Catch me looking with those bedroom eyes
Asking if you're gonna finish those fries
Tryna say you really care about me
But then you put my picture on E.T 
How can I explain to my momma
When you got my beard on Obama
I do not complain, I am not a whiner
But why am I sitting on the Seinfeld diner?

I feel like I'm swimming upstream
Against all of these memes
Why do they attack me?
And then attack my favorite team?

Look, I'm not just a picture, I have feelings too
Like, how would you feel if it happened to you?
If I came after you, did a meme of her
Yeah cause your sketch got cut after dress rehearsal 
What if I found your moment of pain
And used it for my own comedy gain?

Now you know what I mean
That I'm more than a meme

And look, I get that my face is expressive
But some of the memes are a little aggressive
I would just say it's a little excessive
When you go make me the face of Progressive
I know it's not important
But when they catch my face contorted
And the meaning gets distorted
I can only help but feel like crying Jordan
I'm more than a meme

Oh, ladies and gentleman, do I have a treat for you tonight
Rihanna is here tonight, make some noise
Oh I'm so excited to be here tonight
Oh my God, oh my God


Yeah, see Drake ain't a meme, meme, meme, meme, meme
But it nah seem, seem, seem, seem, seem, seem
Another joker getting, getting, getting, getting, getting
I swear we only friend, friend, friend, friend, friends...
Alright, Rihanna's incredible ladies and gentleman
Make some noise for her please


I should take it as a sign of self-esteem
It feels like I'm the victim of an internet scheme
It's just hard when it seems
You don't love me for me
You just love me for memes
They tellin' lies on Hot 97, that's how it goes
I told 'em fire Funk Flex, then I'll come and do your show
Plus me and Kanye, we just left out of the studio
My first night in the Garden, I'm feelin' like D. Rose


I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

If ya'll dont like me then 
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend im just sayin man 
They be gettin jealous when you paid, savin everything they made, I keep thnkin that 
Telling people my image is lame, and im whats wrong with the game, but im feelin like 
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice


Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

* bonus song off of Comeback Season
 
Check 
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
 
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like I ain't getting service in your area
You be like Nigga get your bars up
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong
I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby! 

Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like what being rich feel like, fo real
This life shit is everywhere, you can't control it
Too much going on
Too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
You, you, you
Make me wanna take you down through there
Make me wanna take you down through there
I'll take it there

Why you never come to where I stay?
Always hiding out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay?
If anybody knows, girl, you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushing and forcing it?this isn't making sense
Why are we focused on things
That don't even mean nothing, girl?
Why can we not find the time
And sit down and discuss it, girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

Me and you are playing house
Start thinking that I'm losing touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgetting what it is
Start to think I got to get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
If I'm working then I know you working
Keep in touch with other women
Cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgetting what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

And you don't ever come to where I stay
You just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay
If anybody knows, girl you know, I know
Why are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be some day
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man

Check

Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though

It's been a couple weeks
Out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge
It's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some
I have desired some
But that time is done
Now I am gon'
Give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical
Maybe if we spend a few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures
This bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin'
I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch
Holla at me

Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my 
Let me give you my  
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around
 
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel
Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill
Man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot
So ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

Look
Been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'

You see bad bitches and fall in love
I be talking arithmetic in the club
Re-negotiations
Young Frank I seen all of your favorite girls naked
Mental pictures were taken I never forget they faces
They're lucky I can't draw, but still I'm artistic
Money on the way It's got both of my palms itching
You boys in the wrong business. For real
You boys in the wrong business
All this sitting back and watching will make you a strong witness
Testify on how I'm living
Make sure it's non-fiction
Dont leave out anybody that put me in this position
We couldnt have done it better
We changed this city forever
Puffin shisha
Lay back fucking with FIFA
What I get for the feature I wouldn't fuck with me either for real
Now I'm in it for the hoes and the checks
Care less about respect from niggas I never met
Champagne

Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'

You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah

Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way

A lot of people get famous and then dont want to be famous
You signed up for this you gotta pay for it. A lot of people
Just dont know what the price is when they step up to the
Plate. The wear and tear is not physical. The wear and tear
Is a mental thing. You really just let go of a lot of relationships
That require presence and constant nurturing. You
Say goodbye to people, people get sick and die when youre
Gone, and a lot of things just go by the way side. Then
Theres all the strife, and power, and money, and control.
- Ross Valory
They'll never truly know but
Thank you to all who try to understand
Nothing was the same
This album is dedicated to the memory of Evelyn Sher and Bruce Smith


Want me to feel like I'm new
Want me to watch you do you
Don't, girl, you look so nice
But you're not nice, you're rude
Look what you're putting me through
I'd never do this to you

I need to hold the corner and then slow whine it
One time, yeah

It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone


It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall
Yeah, I swear to God that I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more, No more , No more, No more, No more
No more , No more, No more
No more , No more, No more
No more , No more, No more
No more , No more

It's over, it's over, yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid that I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone, I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road, I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something to say then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say then say that then
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
No more, No more , No more
No more , No more,  No more
No more , No more,  No more
No more , No more,  No more
No more, No more

I gotta go out and get it, want you to know what I did
Want you to know how it went
That's why I keep telling you over and over again
Just let me go
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home

The clock that youve been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands will say
They'll say

Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown dont show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I needs an address and Im on my way
Dont fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise its worth waiting for
Because Im on my way

Won't hurt, it's just some turbulence we're dropping
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
I'll keep you safe, so safe

Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown dont show no mercy
Oh, oh think about the last time I came through
Had something more than a gift for you
And I ain't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Oh, oh baby I just landed
'Bout to get my bags in
All I needs an address and Im on my way
Dont fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise its worth waiting for
Because Im on my way

Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way
Ahh ohhh, I'm on my way

I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit, Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find you
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money," like Osiris


Are we done?

I dont know. Are we?




Young Money

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's rightI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
"Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither"
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's rightI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last yearwho the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's rightI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's rightI'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'mma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
And I'm a leave on one more note
One more motherf*ckin note
It's like this... Look at him
I ain't been here in a minute
Cut the lights off I feel fantastic right now baby...
Yeah... Look...
I said I used to cut the porch lights on and now I cut the porches lights on just to let them know their foresights wrong
Where this rapper going with that obscure ice on he a lame I'm just tryna get my mature life on
O D
O. D. Everybody know me, even fans that resemble them kids in the O.C
Oh me Oh my them girls love me like Seth Cohen
So get a grip get a glass pour the X. O. in
I did want one these niggas to say that I'm not the same
Pick a road cause where you drivin is not a lane
And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no pinky just a lotta Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on 
You prolly could have predicted I'm on 
My sense of judgment is a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisha is blown
Ahh... I'm grown I'm grown I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming round
I got pent house walls I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over 
But moneys over 
Cause money's under 
My life is such a 
That's not the way it has to go it's jus what I prefer
And do not disagree with me it's best you jus concur
I'm a legend with a legacy that can't help but survive
Even when I f*ckin die they gonna bury me Alive...
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
P P P Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good 
Bithces over there... we good 
Money on the floor we good
O.D. O.D everybody know me
Oh no Travie high on life again... 
Feel like I swallowed a whole bottle of Vicodin... 
So high I wanna cry like tiny violins
In my best mode the pesmote enjoy the silence... 
Stop the violence, how when every blind is like the motherf*ckin Watts riots pouring out my pen
Iight dam be easy I'm a get back
Gentleman with a superlative use of syntax
And I done gave up the narcotics but I can't leave the crib without some xanax in my water... 
Hello my name is Travie and I'm a life-aholic
Told'em all these beats is like the Wallis to my Gromit... 
The alpha to my Bruce wearing stripes on my candy cane
Worn without the other so for real without the candy brain
Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how I'm livin bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peeping off the meter man
I'm a live forever in Neverland with Peter Pan
F*ck pulling the nine out
I'm a pull a Amy Winehouse
Sipping Purple Rain with Mary Jane girls in my house... 
Isaiah I'm a see ya when I get there
Until then hold me down like gravity it's Travie... Uno... Easy
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
P P Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good 
Bithces over there... we good 
Money on the floor we good
It's Mickey
O.D. O.D everybody know me
Ha I'm bout to overdose on life somebody please pass the weed
So if I comatose tonight you won't have to ask for refer
If the things that I seen through my Prada frames got me paid
Watch me mane I'm cocky slave with this Rocky chain
I got I got my fames cluttered with this bud
And this name of it is Fame and it's all up in my blood
Tyna suppress the too fresh feeling I got... Oooo yes
I'm in it for the huge yes duplex living like I'm Hugh Heff
Every other night I need a blue net for group sex
Leaving with a bruise neck then I yell whose next... 
Stand'em in a line this is new fax city take this crack between ya thighs... 
 I'm promethazine f*ck the queen
Sniff the white horse of success and then let him lean... 
Tryna match my high on life... 
Gotta catch the spot on my flight
First class known of the aroma of the smoker life
Got me like a stoner, a zoner but nah it's never over... 
I stick my tongue out sippin Remy conceited of I'm teasing every bum out
Hung out with celebrities from every drug house
So when you remember me say that I was strung out... 
I'm a addict for the green cash I'm a O.D. so flip going to rehab
And I'm so prestigious
I brought my niggas from the hood to the beaches
I'm living good gripping wood with all the features
Jesus my money straight no creases
P P Peep this
We got bottles over here
Kush is in the air... we good 
Bithces over there... we good 
Money on the floor we good
O.D. O.D everybody know me

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club 
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

Own it
It's yours
It's yours

Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

Niggas talk more than bitches these days 
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time? You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Paschi paschie

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, whats up with y'all?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
Im urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
Youre never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
Im on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This aint the life that Im used to
Reintroduced to people Ive been introduced to, did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I wont remember? I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
Im halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I dont drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of yall got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, Ive been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we dont really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, Im not saying Im the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I havent hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, Ill never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know

Hope you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you
Would've came back, would've came back

Hold on, hold on, fuck that. Fuck that shit. Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute. Fuck that shit. Still on this mothafuckin' record. I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all. Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better.

Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

Um, trying to think of the right thing to say

Uh, It's 10 O'Clock on a Wednesday and I know your home 
Driving up and down your street hoping you that come outside 
Cause I just got paid and I'm winning bout to call you on it 
And I just need you to see me, oh, oh 
Charlie says it seems that will make it all better 
Selfish says it is, this just aint bout you, no 
Did me wrong every time we were together, gether
So thats why, Im gonna stunt on you
Im gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could have made it all on my own

Ugh ...

You're crazy to wanna play this game
You don't wanna play this game with me
I know how to push your buttons
How you want it
Girl it's all the same
When you had me you didn't show me love
Now I made it I'm all up in this club

And I got Drake all on this song
Watch your girlfriends sing along
You did me wrong so ...

I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own

It's ten o'clock on a Wednesday and I know you're home
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me ohh ou ohh
Childish as it seems it will make it all better better
Selfish as it is this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together
And that why ...

I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own

All on my ...

Girl I just wanted to stunt ...
Girl I just wanted to stunt on you, on you

I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go
Little did you know
I could of made it
All on my own
DONTHRILLA BITCH!
Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha
Coming Soon...

Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!

I recognize your fragrance 
You ain't never gotta say shit 
And I know your taste is
A little bit  high maintenance 
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you
When you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and them?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P. S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song alright

I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun s**
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress

Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P. S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
S** drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P. S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a
Problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he
Come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, ok? I'mma tell you where
I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, ok? Or where your Grandma stay
Where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, ok? "
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you
Out that mother fucker homie"
Drake:
I can buy it all out
But this the only shit that I sip though
So tell 'em bring the waitress
And I won't even ask what it hit fo'

Send her to the bar like 
Send her to the bar like 
Like them niggas over there wanna..

Hang around us, and I bet you
We'll get to stunt on whoever ya sittin' next to
You put 'em all on, and watch 'em run with it
And then wait for whatever's next when I'm done with it
And niggas show hate, period
It's like they all pregnant, they late, period
Yeah... and shit's all good
The deal got signed and my split's all good
And some people pretendin' that it's all good
Say that shit in person man I wish ya'll would

Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose
We gon' pop, fuck urban

Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt

Quavo, young nigga, I invented you 
Ike Turner with the left hand 
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up, they bit the last move 
I'm a magnet for bad bitches
You got the goin' out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain 
You spent your last fifty 
I got the keys to the streets
You got the key to defeat
I got the keys to the warzone 
You got the key to the peace 

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose off the Henny, 'Roc and a hint of Goose
Ocean deep in my swimmin' pool
Throwin' Dead Prez in my livin' room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch: "Let's go snorkelin'!"
Out in Portland, tryna get in her organs
No, I did not sign with Jay
But I still send a Tidal wave
Yeah, I might just go get the fade
Buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
Yeah, it's lit at the crib, you could stay
Me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake
I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, for the fuck-shit I'm biased
I mix, double the cup when I stress
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Max B out the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith
Skrrt skrrt
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Phelps with the swim moves
Skrrt skrrt, oh
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes


Good God Almightylike back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of coursecompliments of the companyand we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna lastall the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

Yeah, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Every single round y'all
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jess
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Chang, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em "Less is more niggas, plenty of us"

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel


Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit
That y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy a
And not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg

Cash money shit
Cash money shit
I can tell that money's got you working
We've been talking for so long
Now we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

Get it understood yeah, it's all good yeah
Girl I know it's real cause I've been around it
You only want what's real you just never found it
Don't give them no more chances, oh girl they had their turn
Everything for a reason, there's things you had to learn from them
But when I get you to myself
You know what's going down, what's going down

Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up

You telling me it's only been a couple other people that you've been with
I'mma trust you I'mma give you the benefit of the doubt, and I'mma love you
You can even call me daddy, give you someone to look up to

All my girls from the 504

And we're finally here in person
I taste pain and regret in your sweat
You've been waiting for me, oh-ho
I can tell that you been practicing
I can tell that you been practicing
All those other men were practice, they were practice
Yeah, for me, for me, for me, for me

I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type, yeah
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight, yeah
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

Young nigga preach

Yea, Boy wonder

Toronto I got you

I'm a hard guy to get along with
Get on a song with
When shit be going right, well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to
The artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it "playing checkers"
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the President
Someone cut the lights on! Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you trying to zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they trying to get their swagger right
Cause I dunn came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue?
Oops! I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, Soo-woo!
Bet he felt like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And no the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo though

Yea, um, I'm going in!
Drizzy I got us, this is my promise
Ima bring the barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up, will fuck up your skin
I pick buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I will butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin
I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut, you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school
Cause bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf, hoody too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything as good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for everything for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone. Like a dog motherfucker I am going for your neck
In a sec, intercept
Bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up, yo I am heading to the buck like
Buck-Buck again. Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine! Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'mma do it, I did it
Got my city on my fitted
Bout to pop a lets get it
Lets get it motherfucker whatcha waitin on
It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm with it if money is the it you want me with
And I prolly just spit on the chick you won't be wit
And I hate a boney bitch only like em only thick
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jas what it do
The haters are there facing and their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid by the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes we rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note
How long can he could go
Wondering when he stop
Bitch when the beat stop
So I'mma keep rockin' to the sheet rock bend
Then the heat I send burn skin
The end

Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you 
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

Say to youbut 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to youa Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know

Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white snakes to, ooh wee
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably is
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
And from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But, yo, this hook is for my exes

This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly?
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryina find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what mean

This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

From the moment she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

Let's go
Ladies and gentalmen
We are now broadcastin live from london england
Back then it was me plus you, we us two did ever single thing that we must do
You trust me me trust you, plus there's noone else that I see just you
Now adays I'm riding on the banwagon driver of a porche caiyan wagon
Ice in the necklace light skinned and hectic and all these simple things got a man braggin
And bostin a little never drank much in the past but now they got the kid toastin a little
So cheers to the fact you here in the track you shoulda been shotgun his career in the back
And his two month lease expires right now knew I shoulda got me a truck with two front seats I assume it's
Done I'm lookin at my passenger side I realize that there's room for one oh

Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Now adays you be all cried out no more tears no more plains cus you all flyed out
Need the lord in your life on a sunday no more fashion nomore spendin your life on the runway
Deal with it you hardly can all this hype around Drake whatever happened to Aubrey Graham
Well it's her hes needin you gotta say leave in the word but I know leavin has crossed your mind
You jealous of some autographs I often sign I try to make it to dinner never often time
But I often find myself hearin your voice you said you never fealt a touch soft as mine
I was sayin how the range and the loft is mine had to change in the planes and the porche is mine
It's a deal I was forced to sign but I never imagined that youd end up fourth in line no

Shes got a feelin lonely 
Like she don't even know me 
I thought that she would be the one for me but now I see that
If I could turn back the hands of time she would be mine
Your on my mind girl let's rewind it back
Look this for that girl that you use to see for anybody that want it how it use
To be all the love afection and all the cash I wanna rewind but we movin forward fast

Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
And I adore all the pictures that everyone in the media is dyin for
Back when there was one camera to smile for
There was only couple things I could buy you compared to now where I'm kinda like heres a thou
Drop grands thru appear in style but I could still be chillin in sweat pants and a stainless ring
Without you I havnt gained a thing oh

Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
Cus I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back
Can we rewind it back should we just let it go
I use to be someone that fit into your scheduale
Now there's no time I see so one plus you but minus me
It makes me cry in fact can we please rewind it back

You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like oh well
You're like, "Fuck it. Oh well"
My past behind me like a pony tail

But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

Okay I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
Drake:
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
Sexy senorita, I feel your aura
Jump out that new motor
Get in my flying saucer
I'll make you call me daddy
Even though you ain't my daughter
Baby I ain't talking books
When I say that I can take you across the borders
I'm young and free, I'm London G
I'm tongue in cheek
So baby give me some time to drink
Slow and steady for me
Go on like a jezzy for me
And say the words soon as you're ready for me
I'm ready for ya
Hit 'em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for, you saying no
I run this game, just play a role
Follow my lead, what you waiting for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over

I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer

Nothing on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over

I decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer

Yeah I hear you talking
Don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up 
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand 
I, I, I'm ready for ya
I, I, I'm ready for ya
So keep thinking you the man
Cause it's all part of my plan
I, I, I'm ready for ya
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
Ca-a-an you fe-e-el my He-he-he-he-heart is beatin'
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over...
Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now
Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray
You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters
Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like
You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl

Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl

A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist

Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God

I was stealin' from a bitch 
Back when I was 21 
My favorite gun was a SIG 
20 in the clip, head one 
Growin' up, I was a running back
You never made me ran once 
I got shot, sweat started runnin'
That shit was red like Hunt 
I'm kickin' pimpin' like I punt 
But don't you think shit's sweet?
I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat 
I'm talkin' suite like he sleep 
We ain't doin' too much talkin'
I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech 
Like the President, I kill 'em neat 
Im talkin' neat like freak
I'm talkin' neat like fleek
I'm talkin' neat like a geek
You come with beef, I eat a B
I'm talkin' Bs, spellin' bee 
Double R, that's a Rolls, paint it yellow like it's dairy
I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick
I'm talkin' rolls like a belly 
Like a new car, I got two keys
Tryna score the bucket like a Chevy seat
Then I heard they been pullin' all week
I'ma use ya name like, "Who is he?"
You get it? I said I'm a username like, "Who is he?"
Got some gold on, leprechaun, sheesh
Deep sleep short for deceased
Big bezel on the Patty 
Im talkin' PADII meant Patek
Don't try to take it, I got guns
I'm talkin' guns, not pellets
I watch the game from the floor 
I'm talkin' wood, first mattress
I'm talkin' wood, pants down
I'm talkin' woods like them clowns 
I got my mink off a monkey
I'm talkin' monkey like Jumanji 
All your diamonds partly sunny
I'm talkin' sunny like D, Sunny 
My diamonds wet, it cost me money
I'm talkin' wet like it's runnin' 
I'm talkin' wet like Katrina 
I'm talkin' wet like Dasani, huh

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to

Can I, can I save you from you?
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you've been sippin's not supposed to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do, yeah
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

Cause who am I to judge you on the past, girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you

Look, dress hanging off your shoulder, barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl, quit playing you just drunk. You just saying shit
Oh you dance, dance like how, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait... No, I get it girl, I'm with it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, I wonder why I never why I learned my lesson
It's feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard it's nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it's been a while, and I swear that this ones different
That's why I'mma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And I'm slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And I swear I'm just trying to correct it
And I fall...

I swear I always fall for your type, yeah, for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type, for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I just can't explain this shit at all
I believe in people like you
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe
If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change
Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby

Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics, I can't live and hold the camera
Someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
Everybody talks and everybody listen
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh they did Poe, at least they tried to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to nahh
But 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Boy, in my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause this 'Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel
Problem with these other niggas they ain't never real
Yea ... that's all I can say

Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look

I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh

I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them up
Verse:
Yeah yeah uh
I'm feelin' you, gauranteed that you into me
I got the phantom, the aston, the bent-e-ley
But let me tell you where a nigga at mentally
Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy
Ha! but I guess it's just the pimp in me
All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me
I ain't worried it's gon happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living seperate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate
I ain't a mind reader though, so if you tryna escape
Then let me know that, show that
My place, roll back, lay down, so flat
Tell Me!
...I think they hearin' you now, someone said nigga they takin' you seriously now, I'm like "I think they just might be scared of me now", but it's all good niggas wrong everyday, niggas wrong everyday, oh...
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the bangers
Su-woop to the bangers, 
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch
Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cause I don't have the time for thatt
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG
I a'int have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now
Su-woop to the

Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball

Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world


I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you

How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a goodshow me a good
Show me a good time 

I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time 
Show me a good time 
Show me a goodshow me a good
Show me a good time 

How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our natureyoung and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made itYup!

How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

Show me a good time

Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you...

Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it

Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
They ain't got nothing on you
Ki-Killa, Killa

Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice 
That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice  they'd notice
You shut it down

TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious

You shut that thing down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down 
You shut it down, you shut it down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
You shut it, ohh
And they'd notice, they'd notice

You looking good girl, go, go, go get em girl
Go, go, go hit em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go

The way Im feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know its getting late, but girl I dont want you to leave
You tell me youre just not the type, you wanna do this right
And Im not trying to say I dont believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, its worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you wont forget me
Youll be happy that you let me

Lay you down, down, down

They'd notice, they'd notice

And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it

Side pieces
I know that you're watching this from home
I can't wait to see you on the road
Cheering from the shadows I hear you calling out
Wifey sees a text and asks what's this all about
I tell her you're just a friend
A lot of these guys are dying for this song to end
I'm asking would you be mine
Would you get on this flight to Cleveland, Ohio at 2:45
I had a rough game I took two shots I was 0 for 2
Tough day I need that one thing only you can do
Skylar this is the one thing that I'd be for you
This goes out to all my side pieces
Side pieces, side pieces
This goes out to all my side pieces
You know that you'll never be the main one
City to city I see you wearing the same one
Side pieces, side
Los Angeles I want you to make some noise for the real king of side pieces Brian McKnight one time

This is dedicated to all of the side pieces
I know you'll never be more
And you'll always be less
But there's comfort in knowing that you're okay being second best
I already got a starter but I'm looking for the rest of my team
Side pieces in training go on and wave your hands for Drake and me

Side pieces where you at?

I know you're not down here in front of us you got to be way back in the back

Side pieces go on and be, side pieces yeah
Side pieces

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pool in my eyes
As you beg, I testify that
I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun"
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

We gotta listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you dont know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you, girl, I know you

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next
Girl, I can't pretend

We gon' have to listen to some old Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down
I know you, babe

Girl, I know you know already
What haven't we done before?
What is not already mine?
Couldn't tell you what's not yours
Yeah, you know already
Tell you what's not yours
Tell you what's not yours
Part II

Six months since I've been back in the Six
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been

I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was
These streets got so familiar
Malibu coast where I meditate
Book a plane home, then I hesitate
Scared to see what I left behind
It's weighin' heavy on my mind
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe

What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
What are you on?
Gotta let me know something
Wonder how you've been, babe

R. Kelly
You slipped out if you don't know already
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know already
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Things are gettin' hot and heavy
Girl, I know you know already
Girl, I know you know how it's gon' go down

It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, that's a catfish
Block that account, that's a catfish

You don't know me, you better get to know me
Stand up tall, right next to Kobe
A young G, I had the weapon on me
Slice up work like pepperoni 
The police still arrest the homies
No statement, no testimony
Spit in your face with extra bogey
It's my time, I don't flex a Rollie
On cloud 9, a man's extra cozy 
I might switch it up and direct a movie
Pussyholes tried to execute me
Died and came back as Fela Kuti
Don't phone me, send a text to Julie
OVO, man's so unruly
South by, ride out, no Suzuki
Got the Austin Powers, a man's extra groovy 
Front row, jacket tailor-made
Crackhead swag with the razor blade
Red umbrella when I make it rain
My whole team winnin', we don't play your game
Sound like me, but they ain't the same 
See them online tryna fake the fame
They wanna bust jokes, they think I'm Damon Wayans 

It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Check my account, that's a madness 
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish

Yeah, they're nothin' like me, I'm a fuckin' villain
Go against me, that's a tough decision 
Police wish I was stuck in prison
Fish-eye lens on my tunnel vision 
Real life greaze when I touch the riddim
Still the same guy when I touched a million
Record labels wanted us to listen
But it's greatness only for the love of Britain
I say it how it is and no fucks are given
Greaze, so don't forget to remember me 
Especially all my enemies
Keep your eyes on me with your jealousy
The most solid gang that you will ever see 
Just came back from the embassy
Check my crime sheet, check my legacy
And now I'm back on tour, so what you tellin' me?
 Taliban, Halloween 
Pull up in the whip with the gasoline 
Yeah, that's that boy from the magazine 
Bust my dance at the cash machine
Make her back it up, bounce on my trampoline
Like Martin Luther, man, I had a dream
Now it's my world, you can have the scene

It's a madness
Check my account, it's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Check my account, that's a madness
Check my account, that's a madness
Block that account, it's a catfish
Block that account, it's a catfish
Hey girl

That way you can call me
Every time I come into town
And then I will
Drive up to your house and
Take you out to dinner
I dont expect nothin at all
Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss

Slow slow slow
Hey girl

Mini Golf or ice cream

Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
Or if I dont call you back
Prove you right
Or this last
Just one night

Slow slow slow
Instrumental
Chorus:
But what if we happen to kiss
And we touch
Put a rush on it
And get over with
Or what if I just know
What you like
And it feels right
Then its over with
Or if I dont call you back
Prove you right
Or this last
Just one night

Slow slow slow

I see you sitting at home
Nobody's calling you on the phone
Your girls out making a night on the town while you're sitting there all alone
I suggest you come with your crew
Y'all are looking for something to do
Cause I understand pain is love and that's exactly why I wrote this little something for you
It's for you, it's for you, it's for you, for you 

Ladies up north represent representing
Ladies down south represent representing
When the mic is in my hand I'm never hesitant
My favorite jam back in the day was Eric B For President, it's evident
She spend her summers in Jamaica and I love that
They say that she should be a model she's above that
She had a rapper break her heart, had to open her
So she don't even mess with rap, only spoken word
Well, I'm a poet so you know it's get her to going down
And after all this is my city I could show you round
I understand that the shit you facing is crazy
Let me hear your views on the situations in Haiti
Or sit back relax, vibe with ya man
Chill we could talk about Tribes in Sudan
Cause you gotta understand if I said it then I meant it
I understand that you Afro I'm tryna get to your centric
That's why I got a bottle of Champagne and then I sent it
Over where you sitting, noticed, pretend you didn't
Along with the bottle was a note attached
Here's some tickets to my show you should go to that
And it's a shame money's something that you barely need to knock her
I'm tryna treat her right cause she barely treated proper
But you showed up regardless of late choices it's clear
You really came to kick it it with Drake, Voyce and Amir like


Cause love 
You know that love is in the air 
I should feel it everywhere
So smile 
So smile for me one time and I guarantee we gon have a good time 
Cause love 
So smile 

We got London On Da Track

This is all God's doing, man, you can't plan it
But if the devil's in the details, then I'm satanic
'Bout to take over your city and you can't stand it
My accountant say you sinking like the Titanic
David Blaine last summer, man, you had to vanish
I get the hits like somebody pitching underhanded
Got my Spanish ting convinced that I know Spanish
Really, when she get to talking I don't understand it
You ain't own it right away, you had to wait on niggas
Man, I'm only 29, have some patience with us
Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga
I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga
Shit ain't been the same like before
I still love it but I used to love it more
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts
Cause she know that we at war, yeah

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in a fucked up position
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro

Baby, I'm a savage, I ain't romantic
When I come around these rappers, niggas start to panic
And they pockets goin' under like the Titanic
Got some head last night and it was outstandin'
They was hatin' on me then and they hatin' now 
She was playing with me then but she waitin' now
Used to sleep inside a den, I got acres now 
I was fighting niggas then but I'm spraying now 
I don't pay no mind to no sneak diss 
I won't spend a dime on a freak bitch 
Niggas takin' cheap shots on some cheap shit 
They the type to stand in line for some free shit 
Baby girl gon' suck it 'till her jaws locked 
She gon' make me put my bitch on call block 
We the ones poppin', we the ones shoppin' 
We the one droppin' niggas, we the ones 
They the ones duckin' when them heaters come 
You that nigga snitchin' on your people, huh? 
21 Savage A.K.A. The Reaper, huh 
Pussy niggas gettin' shot for all that reachin', huh

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in a fucked up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't

I don't need love, I'm the GOAT, I just hit the beat and float
And I'm selling out arenas, but you putting on a show
I been tryna change life around for everyone I know
Cause if I don't share the wealth
Then how the fuck we supposed to grow
Mom's stressed, there's a lot of things we need
Chain smoking in the house, it's hard to breathe
I used to have to hit my T's with Febreze
Jordan pull up in the TL, now I'm cheese
I'mma turn this TSX into a Benz soon
I'mma see a lot of blessings for my friends soon
150-inch screen in my bedroom
6'1", man, a nigga need some leg room
Shit ain't been the same like before
They ain't even wanna look up at the score
FaceTime with my shawty on tour
And she texting purple hearts
Cause she know that we at war, yeah

Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Can't afford mistakes, not on this end
Make me call my bros for assistance
You gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Niggas keep reaching and dissin'
Put me in a fucked up position
Make me call my bros for assistance
Make me call my bro, don't

Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go
Is this a dream?
Looking like every picture
That I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before

Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time

But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all
I guess it's what we make it
I guess it's what we make it
I guess it's what we

I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it


When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on
You don't need no one else 

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go, whoa

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on
You don't need no one else 

The girl or the world?
You see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If I'm never on your mind
Nights fallen, lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going
Is it worth it? That decision
Because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance, I swear

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on
You don't need no one else 

Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh


You can't just love me like they do

I need someone special in you

I know that out there theres a few

See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?

She gotta be special

By that I mean that you gon hold me down

You gotta be special

Cause you never know how people stick around

Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

You can just love me like they do

I need someone special in you

I know that out there, theres a few

See I've been searching, I dont know what to do

Can you help me?

Special

By that I mean that you gon hold me down

Gotta be special

Cause you never know how people stick around
Special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

Look theres requirements to be an admirer
Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple
All you have to do
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh

You can't just love me like they do

I need someone special in you

I know that out there theres a few

See I've been searching I don't what to do

Can you help me?
Special

By that I mean that you gon hold me down

Special

Cause you never know how people stick around
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

Vo and D-R
Vo and D-R-A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see 
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me 
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see 
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came -A-K-E
We them boys that you came to see 
Yep we take it to the same degree
So let loose since you came with me 
Vo, D-R-A-K-E
We them boys came to see 
Yeah we take it to the same degree
So let loose cause you came 

That's what they doin', camera on, they actin' like these singers, man
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer
Who gonna be on the hook? Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you



Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out, the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear what?
Yo hear what, tek time
 Ahh, nuh shake
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan fry skull
Him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van
You know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing
Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we..

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

We were sellin things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now Im jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin loud on my way to Mr. Chows
I say: aint it funny now, nigga, this bracelets fifty thou
He say he gon hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin just from lookin at my pictures
Plottin on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home
But Imma hit her, did I mention, 30 grandll get you gone
Youll come up missing cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon need a green card for the Cuban link 
Cancel my account, Ill probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out youd best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin bottles, aint talkin bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up  hold up, wait a minute, yall thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you aint ballin, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin up your re-up every time we in the building
Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin Ros with Rozay and its Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?

Still in the basement, where it started
Uhhh...
Started from the...
Kells

Started from the bottom, now we here
Courtside, you would think I was a Cleveland Cavalier
Im talking 30,000 feet up in the air
And dance leer, 30 minutes later all the fans cheer, bitch
You aint seen this power since LeBron
I went to vegas for my 22nd, rented out the Palms
Now they say illuminati is the cause
Or maybe everyone of yall is lazy and I worked hard
I aint never bowing down for a dollar
Selling my soul to a charter
I wouldnt even take a buck from my father
But they weren't saying that back in the day
When I was hustling tickets to my shows, ask dante
And I heard tempers heating up like a filet
Talking 'bout they run my city when they livin in LA
Sucker, I aint hearin nothing bout a word
Talked about it, been about it, bitch I got what I deserved
See I dont know why everybody mad
You had your chance and you blew it
Meanwhile, Im young and Im ruthless
Meanwhile, the dumb are influenced
Thinking you live like the music
Dont be foolish
My shooters make your face maroon like the Hoosiers 
Suckers always wanna talk funny
Broke motherfuckers never wanna talk money
And since I was being quiet in the past
Im on the top looking down, kiss my ass
Still in the game with my same clique
Still with the hood bitches fuck Cambridge
And when they wanna know if Im real
I say "Bitch I ran my city 'fore I ever had a deal"
Kells

No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we dont feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We dont like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

Came in the game with no lane and then changed it
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
Im smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that its fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, its goin' down, its goin' down, its goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when Im steerin'
Hope the homie Drake dont get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasnt trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we

Started from the bottom now we're here 
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here 
Started from the bottom now we're here

To my beloved fans, it truly breaks my heart that I won't be able to perform as planned at Wireless and Roskilde this weekend. I got sick a few days ago and although I am on my way to bouncing back, my doctors have made it clear that I am not physically fit to fly or deliver the performance my fans expect and deserve from me. I will be focused on resting for a quick recovery. I have the best fans in the world and I can't wait to come back to make more incredible memories together

Still...
Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up
Drake tell em what the fuck is up

I used to cut the porch lights on
And now I cut the Porsche lights on just to let em know their foresight's wrong
Where this nigga going with that obscure ice on
He a lame, I'm tryna get my mature life on
I asked what happen, or whats hattenin', hattenin'
Hop up out the passenger and help me back the phantom in
Damn, I never got to use that in a convo
Never got the chance to put you back in a condo
And, and
It couldn't be more true
I always meant to get you that villa in Corfu
Women I pass off, and money I tore through
Now all I really need is the number before 2
Is it over, tell me it isn't over
They told me it was easy as I get a little older, yeah right
And this is what my life outro sound like
Even though Dre did it this shit don't sound right
I was, born to do it, born to make bomb music
I flow tight like I was born Jewish
Well, actually I was born Jewish
I guess at this point you could say I was born foolish 
Yea, what about the grammy's and the bubbly
What about all my fans that be loving me, I
Used to chill in them spots where the trouble be
But never ended up in that menage at the Double Tree
What about that girl Rita down in Basque
In L.A Swear I would of never cheated on your ass
But you ain't give me yo number cause them niggas got to fighting
Situation got me thinking and that's when I got to writing, hmm...
Change these hundreds for me cashier
Cause I ain't made it but I'm better off than last year, yeah
And what it look like hun'
I never got to make it rain but it look like fun
And, uh, a king is what I'm fit to be
I don't get these niggas, they a mystery
I mean they talk so quiet as if it its private
And they don't ever bring that shit to me, but
Man I ain't live life so wrong
I said fuck a couple dudes, cause I ain't like yo song
Least let me tell you why I'm this way
Hold on...

I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty
Motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin'
Ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows
We fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy
Please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like 
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin', no luggage

I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you
Where you're from, where your bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog

I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog

Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But

I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a "nigga"
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist


Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been


I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world

I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't

And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back

Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is


I tell her
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully I'll let them see
What they say that I'm gon' be
And if not then I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve
Without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them
I am not them. I photoshop them...out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah
The Chris Paul
Of this fall
Sittin' this tall
I float high
Goodbye
I will miss y'all

I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world

I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't

And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back

Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is


If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel
And I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles
I need a stuntdouble
Yeah!
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah!
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah!
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O
Yeah!
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah!
I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me
I'll say fuck you like Wilt
Yeah!
Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah!
Talkin' big big shit
I am rude
I take food
From a kid picnic
Nigga
Yeah!
And we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars
Haha

I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world

I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't

And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back

Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is


I stunt hard. I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder
I live in the Carter
I think forward
All I see is tommorow
I need me
I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you trying to see more
Better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur?
And the Feds will never get me
Like a backwards
Password
Black spur
Go some like Pacman, cats first
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister
Ask her
Am I their man
Her answer
Is yessir
Shit
I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA
'Bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world

I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't

And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back

Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is


It's 10 O'clock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Drivin up and down your street
Hopin that you'll come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me
Childish as it seems, it'll make it all better, better
Selfish as it is, this just ain't about you no
Did me wrong every time we were together, -gether
And that's why
I'm gonna stunt on you
I'm gonna stunt on you
You let me go, little did you know
I could've made it all on my own

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of ya'll are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother try to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5'2"
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hoping I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though cause I want the:
Alright well, umm alright.  Youll just have to do it without me
You know what you do you know what you do nigga. You making it to the top, all the way to the top. You need to go further than mine, and not the money, you know what Im saying

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading water, steady trying to swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"
Or call me Mr. "Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubted is about to get busy
I'mma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much, all I want is the

I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Yeah, its like, like I know what i gotta say
I just dont know how to say it, to you

Pardon the swag, but bitch it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'mma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell "God"
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details, boy

Hip-hop is like school, yeah I had to
Learn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah
I had to burn it. They finally showing me
Respect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to
The finishing line, ain't got no time for
U-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven
Times you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies
Inside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you
Want to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag
On, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to
Be your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted on my neck they love my vocal


As I sit back and spit this crack and leaking
On the internet and watch my haters react
50 said they can't read between the lines so
I jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline
I know you thinking damn Soulja going hard
Right now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the
Start right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade


Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy
Soulja Boy I tell 'em
Money, money, cars, cars

Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldnt say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
Oh its your time now yeah, thats what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Yes pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what Im saying
Im that niggas what Im saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
Im not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as Im back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, theyll be out here

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

Ooh, baby, yeah

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
...

Yeah
Right
Ahhhhhh
Aiight
I'm bout to do my thing
You ready?
Here I go!
October's very own
Drizzy
Taz You ain't even got nothin to worry about man
Check
Yeah

Are you listening?
Is anybody listening?
Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think I'm writing with John Ghrisam
Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope

By the way I'm Jewish and turnin 22
Get's depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but I'd still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow
You should tell them boys duck down

Girl I know you wanna, you know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Hotter than the 6 in the summer, that ass, girl I wanna

Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Yeah, she keep giving me looks
Yeah, girl I know you wanna
She's a spice, ride pipe like bike, like Yokohama
She heard the ting bend like banana
So she wanna give me the adunana-ne

She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
I say why don't we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends

Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna
Girl I know you wanna
You know I wanna

Shawty too fly though, that's all I know
She don't sing songs, but if I go strong she gon' hit this high note
She know she working with the nana
And she wanna give me the adunana-ne

She say I'm a sweeterman
But she say that she don't need a man
What if we make an agreement then
We can just fuck while we're being friends

Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl

Ride the pipe like a bike, oh
Do the things you know I like, oh
I'm the man in my ends, oh
You're the one, let's not pretend

Cause the pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm too sprung, I, I, I
The pussy too good, drink too strong
Yiy too change, I'm so gone, I, I, I

Girl I know you wanna
I know you wanna
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl I know you wanna
I know you want to girl
Girl I know you wanna, I, I, I

She keep giving me looks 
She keep giving me looks 
She keep giving me looks
I need you right here beside me
If you oblige me, I'll hang it up, and I'll never come out of retirement
You should just sleep on it, you shouldn't doubt me
It would be different without me
What is it without me
Don't go do nothing without me
This is a blessing, mashallah, wallahi
I swear my life stories better than stories they tellin' bout me
They got it twisted
Ride the pipe like a bike, make sure you're going the distance
And if he wasn't with it, then why were you with him?
Maybe you just had to realize
That  knowing the difference can make all the difference
She wanna ride me that adanunana
Yeah she keep giving me looks

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do...you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you.. instead they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

Verse 2:
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love
Cuz I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where its at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggas for that Louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch
And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey there, help me
I've been away too long and I know you'd agree
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
My door's open and that don't mean leave
Know what I mean?

Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me 
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

Don't rush, but don't wait
Don't talk 'cause it's gettin' late
Sit right here, next to me
What's up? Your talk is cheap

Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Boy, you gotta push my buttons
The ones that turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

You know I gotta ask
What's up with the friends that you bring?
Know you got some other cool friends that you never bring
New stories for you every time the phone ring
They don't understand, girl if anything you're everything
Oh lord, good lord, smoke a little, then record
You know Papi on the vocals, 40 on the boards
Call me when you feel inspired, never when you're bored
And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man
How come everything is always on the other hand?
How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?
I want you wearin' what you came into the world with

This is your chance to prove that you got the skill
Don't let me fool yah
Boy, you don't know me
Suppose I said I want you
This very moment
You said you could give me the chills
Come here and let me school yah
This is how it's done
Well it's all up to you
Boy you gotta push my buttons
But you don't know what to do
The ones that turn me on, turn me on

Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Hey, woo!
Girl this very, very moment, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off 
Baby I can give you extra credit 
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?

Man, you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
And love, I don't mind feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm in the fresh and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would

Can't let you go
I can't let you go
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
You been a bad girl

Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you
Someone's gonna have to
Teach you, teach you, teach you, teach you

You can call me professor
But baby you broke the rules

The 6, Raptors, Diamond, Key
New ride, old ride
Bad times, good times
Young Money, new money
OVO, 29, 29, 29, best I've ever have
Worst behavior
Old crib, new crib
October, sound
Festival, album time again or 
My friends, my friends
Younger me, older me
Me as , me as Jimmy, me as Drake

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Yeah, slightly took a left turn there
But very much 6AM
Slightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam
I'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ

Girl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation

Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

Nowadays you can't get enough of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me
Oh yeah, yeah

What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

Nowadays you can't get enought of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me...
Oh yeah yeah
"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 1

You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

They like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like

Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now
"Tell Me Lies" - Scene 2

Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
And now they like, "Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined."
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain
I came into this world as honest and pure
But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so
]

Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now

Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

Tell me anything but the truth
Can't figure out how I'm supposed to make it now, tell me lies

I said, tell me lies

FIND YOUR LOVE
THANK ME NOW
Bonus track: BEST I EVER HAD
-


You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up the scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
That's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full
But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

You could thank me now, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's okay, you could thank me now

Nuh Shake
Before we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else . Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 . Text me when you are ready to start the next one   @ovo40

Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget them and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't
Cause

You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say dont ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah

Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone try not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a slang
Call me "Heartbreak Drake", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest; as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yea, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me

I said I call this shit the calm
But Im the furthest thing from calm
Swear Im putting on
And everybody wanna ask
What type of act you putting on, like
Man
I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook
A real live lover, could have been a book
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock
I could be
Here and now
I would be, I should be
But how?
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more
Could have been your statue, could have been your friend
A whole long lifetime could have been the end
I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock
I could be even here
I would be, I should be so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I'm out tryna to get his paper


That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exaclty who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's it's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give methe next join
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate

I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum!
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with you back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time  stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga  stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga  stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga  stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it
....

I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall


Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

I'm the fuckin man, you don't get it do yah?
Type of money everybody actin like they knew yah
Go Downtown, nursin home pimin bitttcch
Them black people love me like I'm Salt-n-Pepa
Tell Mama Lu I'm out in Jersey too
Playin cards, Always winnin ain't much to do
Thick rain, needa ride up to Biscayne
Is it a hurricane, goddamn ain't shit changed
How I feel? How I feel? How I feel?
85 sittin on 85 mill uhh
I'm in da buildin and I'm pissin myself
Rest in piece Mike J, I'mma do it for LA okay *he actually died today js*
Gettin played I'll holla whenever that stops
My team dead but I outlived the mascot
I drink Prune Light, pass through me like a gateway
Fried eggs and cheese, you niggas more diet latte
Me, Jenny, Carley Carl at the bingo
Gout goes out to Rico, Grace and Bubs, shout to Kibbo
We got Ensure Margaritas by the liter
She know even when I'm puttin with her, I don't really need her
Aohhh, that's how you feel man?
That's really how you feel?
Cuz my fingers out cold, man these bitches need a grill
I mean maybe they won't
Then again maybe they will
I can almost guarantee they no the deal
Real senior wassup?

Now she goin loco
You already know though
You only win once: that's the motto nigga YOWO
We bout it everyday, everyday, everday
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga all we do is play
Everyday, everyday, fuck what anybody say
Can't see em cause the focals broke away
Real senior wassup?

One, time fuck one time
I'm beatin niggas out like a bonfire
Seven, pounds in the lunch
Almost drowned in the chowder so I ran to the brunch
It's Eastwing, we in this b*tch
Wish a pit would like a dog in this b*tch
And if her ass growl nother breed in that b*tch
I smell like BO add Degree to that shit
I'm f*cked up, worn down
Got twisted, tight bound
Talk stupid, he ate the bread
Nigga money talks like Mr. Lett
My lung so rusty got a plum from the sun
Fertilizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't sh*t sweet niggas on the street eatin boogers
Lung almost touched my toungue
Skeet skeet skeet other lung
Oh my god Freddy, look at her butt saggy

Now she goin loco
You already know though
You only win once: that's the motto nigga YOWO
We bout it everyday, everyday, everday
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga all we do is play
Everyday, everyday, fuck what anybody say
Can't see em cause the focals broke away
Real senior wassup?

It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion

I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from your man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "No strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor 
Talking to you is not enough
I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

I'm the fucking man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, fucking women... ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed

Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'mma do it for the Bay

It's Jorge, back-to-back with Aubrey
And white chicks, dying to back their asses on me
But, I ain't referring to "white-girl booty," niggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Her ass looking like a bag o' laundry
The b*tch a milf; I'm f*cking her with her man's pops
"Charlie Horse" dick's tenderizing her lamb chops
Started off soaked, shorty had the damp twat
Till I hit it all night and left her with a sand box
That's why I'm rarely home. You know a brother busy
Plus, I'm outta town, promoting "... The Wunderwizzy"
But in each and every one of my cities
I've got a wonderful biddy with a couple of double-D titties
You feel me? Life is pretty. You tight cause yours is sh*tty?
Well, don't get it twizzy; my background: gritty
Team Zeta 'bout the paper; the neighbors caught the vapors
Before you try and play us, though, go and get a shape-up, hater

Drake: Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her, oooooohhhhhh...
Zin-Zeta: And I don't really need'em; I just lead'em up, eat'em out
And beat'em up, then leave'em out cold, once the semen's out
Give'em what they dream about, then let'em know the deal
I tell'em it's a one-time thing and "It's been real." You feel me?
Drake: That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimping ice cold; all the bitches wanna chill
I mean, maybe she won't, but again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she'll know the deal. Real nigga, what's up?
Hook:
Zin-Zeta: Dick is on her molar... sippin' Coca Cola
We only lick cunts, got my model lickin' bolas
Drake: And we 'bout it err'day
Zin-Zeta: Err'day
Drake: Err'day
Zin-Zeta: Like we only rent games
Drake: Nigga, we don't really play... err'day
Zin-Zeta: err'day
Drake: F*ck what anybody say
Zin-Zeta: I can't see you cause her...
Drake: ... ass...
Zin-Zeta: ... in the way
Tyga: Real nigga, what's up?
Drake: Now she want a photo... you already know, though
"You only live once"... that's the motto, nigga - YOLO
Zin-Zeta: And we 'bout it err'day
Drake: Err'day
Zin-Zeta: err'day
Drake: Like we're sitting on the bench...
Zin-Zeta: ... nigga, we don't really play
Drake: err'day
Zin-Zeta: err'day
Drake: F*ck what anybody say

T-Raww, skinny nigga big balls
Fuck around and get dragged: Ru Paul
You funny little nigga Duval
Out of this world Total Recall
Call a bitch ride dick like her see saw
Sorta like a donkey, act a ass nigga hee-haw
Ridin round in the rarri wit the top off
While you in the window, man Im probably on my next car
Aight, Mighty duck with the ice on
Real LA nigga, Chucks with the gun drawn
Drawing on your face youre a clown jack in the box
Boy thats your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back
Them my homies, they dont act, acting brand new
Fuck her never call her back
Matt Forte got the bitch running back
Damn, Thats the motto you dont know its like that

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?


Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough clout for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, "Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?"
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money
Who got drug money?
I am talkin "white Phantom sittin' on dub" money
I am talkin "cold champagne at the club" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb?
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
I spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from

Oh!
Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this
Extravaganza that I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay, drinks are on me by the way
Yeah

How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up before they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more Sess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes
I'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl if you don't like me
It's probably due to the fact that you are a les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

Shout out to 40-40
Yeah my right hand!

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you, if I ignore all that advice
Then something isn't right, then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other

Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last.. Tunechi

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies
Coming Soon

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you woulda liked it
I, I, I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

Should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget?
My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters
My enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
"It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!"
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on?
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on
I don't really want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit "redial", you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread
It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say "You promised me you would never change"
"You promised me you would never change"

I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
Yeah, I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over

I hate when,I hate when people say they feel me man, I hate that shit
Itll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever

You wont feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but its not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

You won't feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
Im driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping Ms and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
Im bout to fuck and Im just praying that it feels good
I really dont know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga dont believe it
I mean, sure, theres some bills and taxes Im still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didnt notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
Im out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldnt fuck with my freshman floater 
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, I was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
I've been faded too long
Why won't it stop? The ride
Why won't it stop? The ride

They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

 I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all
 I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on , keep on , keep on 


Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on


I've been out walking
I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do

These days

I've met some women
I wish I had resisted these days
These days
These days I seem to think
About how I have failed
To change all of my ways

These days

Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs

These days

I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming
These days
These days
I sit inside chauffeur car
With windows down and count the stars
These days
These days
Intro:
I wouldn't be me if I didn't get a little nasty
Na na na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na hey
They say all I talk about is sex
Verse :
How 'bout we just pull over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up, ooh we can be bad
That place that ain't been touched, I'm feelin on it
All that juicy fruit, keep spillin' on it
Girl, giddyup, get it up take me on a ride to extacy
You don't wanna pump pump then take a nap
You just wanna pump pump, bring it right back
Watch me , Im'a heat it up beat it up
Hook:
Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon feel something unusual
Verse :
I want to do the freaky things you never do
What if we did it while your friends was in the room
Is that too much for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let them see your sexy ass
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain't got to know 
Watch me heat it up beat it up
Hey, do you hear me girl
Woah watch me heat it up beat it up
Hook:
Bridge:
Restaurants , Cinemas 
On the hood  of the car
Counter top , Balcony 
In the jet , On the beach 
Rap :
This that other shit, You know your asked for it
I might just send you some money to get your passport
So you can come to my city, I'll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony just don't fall over
Send me your picture baby you know I'll never leak it
I know you got something recent for someone decent
Why you laughin' out loud, I'm serious
Bring your girl if she's a little bi-curious
Please, please no story tellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it
I would never let you down
Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you expected
You gon know it when you bring your ass around
Hook:
Outro:
Do it all different ways or different places
Look at the many love faces your makin'
But can you take it
Yall thought I was nasty last time...Leggo

Im performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that its exact
My ex girlll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trend setting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
Im it Im it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'mma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where Im is
Its only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
Its about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I cant sign nothing til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess its not about who you know
Its just how you balance it
Its always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where Im is
Its only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If Im in your starting five you will never need a sub
And Im neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band dont you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldnt leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
Ill forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel I hope heavens prepared for whenever you there

I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Dont cry for me this aint motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isnt at my session
Its the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where Im is
Its only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

A beauty so divine 
Let niggas waste your time that couldn't afford it
And even though I fucked you, i still want you 
Every selfie take so perfect aren't you
Hold on baby I can't even stunt though
Hold on baby I can't get enough no
Open up your doors you lead the way for me
Fuck them other niggas, girl i plan for keeps

Hold on wait a minute I ent ever sipping
But girl i gotta thing for your independence
Like can i get to know you we can take it slow yeah
Im not the one for guessing


Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body got a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Girl i gotta thing for you and you know
Got class, got ass, body like a bottle shape, she don't fuck with any niggas many, niggas by the way


Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though

Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'mma take this hat off, and I'mma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well read like sunburn
And after me you'll never leave no stone unturned

Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

They say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
No El' will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

Uh, we know what you're thinking love
You think we out smoking and drinking love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we're early and be showing up extra late, love
But y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot
With the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
Circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like Macgyver
Cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple a years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
Check
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet
But there's logic behind it
Emotions double and they try to cover up
Like a mansion with the projects behind it
I tend to freak with this
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spending
And all she gave was a decent kiss
Thinking she been spoiled
But golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
And come up with tin foil
We could dissect it see
You take a Dominique or another freak in the sheets
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
Gave her nothing
Her reputation's in jeopardy
Cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
Instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
For thinking that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong
Nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
Love's lost
Love's gone
Love lost
Love is gone
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop
Just throw it in the bag
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups 
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
It's Mr.Throw it in the bag
I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I didn't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front I'm a buy her what she wants
Cause the queen supposed to get what she desire what she wants
If my lady likes to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this cream, she the fire to my blunt
You can try it if you want but it's gon cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
My player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups 
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
Uhh Ahhh
We up in Barneys going dumb again
Everytime we leave the manager say, "come again"
Honestly shes probably old enough to be my momma's friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If the card declined you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money coming in
Yeah, just fold some paper round the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband until she found out he cheats
Then she filed for divorce and watched that bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
He son that's 26 but he just went to away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's a baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaazy
And I be spending all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in 86
Yeah, she say that she lucky that she his
No, I m lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isss
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups 
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean looking right
And you can't put a price on something looking right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's looking like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm booking flights
If I want it I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And it's on everything I got a crazy lady
So money ain't a thing, Jay-z, JD
Like Jay-Z lady, it's Beyonceing
Supporting your woman goes beyond paying
Watching me ball is like LeBron playing
I'm in the Louie shoes you might see Kanye in
They say it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin'
I say it ain't trickin if you got her, she mine
You niggas ain't gotta worry about her, she fine
My player's card approved, ya'll niggas declined, nice
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
She all on me cause all I do is ride around in Bentleys coups 
Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
All we do is shop until we drop 
All all all all all we do is shop until we drop 
Just throw it in the bag
And I roll up looking harder than a....bitch!
Damn a nigga never switch
You should get your cherry bust
Before you fuck around with this!
I buy some Rolexes and pass 'em out as gifts
And when they tell me that's too much
I'm like "No, fuck it, I insist!"
And then we light it up and reminisce
About the things that we would fix
How the fuck we got this rich?
This is just some inspiration
For young niggas on they shit!
This for my young niggas on they shit for real
This also for the hood stars that I created
Whose booking rate went up right after we dated
Girl you made it for real
Hosting parties with athletes or another rapper
Then they trying to fuck you after
Remember when you was my....bitch!?
My special friend with benefits
You remember how you got here?
Hope to God you ain't forget
But the look you're giving me tells me you did
Empty stares across the club
Like y'all don't recognize the kid
But damn, you know what it is
Cameras flashing over here, I know that's something
That you miss, yeah
It been bad, and it gets good
Drizzy Drake and the nigga Tim Westwood
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Gyal a you mi waan
Pay fi yuh visa meck yo fly out regular
Baby, cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Gyal yo pum pum good and yuh fit
Mi wi give you everything weh deh in my wallet
And in my pocket

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

Look...I don't know how to talk to you

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you


Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you


Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh


Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a Walkie-Talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song
Damn

What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

Han't heard records on my demo?
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song

In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy

J's they callin' my phone, they tyin' my line
Labels, they callin' my phone, I don't wanna sign
They sayin' we made our own million dollars
At the top right now I wanna order up a million bottles
We came from juug in the Impala to smashin' them models
We independent, we don't need none of your major dollars

Flippin' and whippin' and spinnin' the dope, I'm hittin' the door
I wrap it in package, I'm shippin' the dope, run off with the the dope, I'm killin' that ho!
I'm takin' a trip to the Bahamas, going to pick up them comma's
And when I touchdown I'll hop in a Zonda
Smokin' on good marijuana in Mexico, call that quintana
Tryna fuck me a Rihanna
Comin' up, just me and Benji
Get rich or die try' like I'm 50
No cupid them bitches be kissin'
The feds they listen, them bricks in the kitchen!

In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy

Sellin' a Grammy like Tony , now I want Grammy's and ceremonies
These niggas snakin', always actin' funny, got the MAC-11, call it macaroni
Always gettin' trophies and recreation, Q.C. the label, the solid foundation
Sittin' at home I was contemplating, changing and switch up my situation
Tryna see the bigger picture, pull up to the award show in my new Fisker
No it ain't no money issue, grant all my momma's wishes
Watchin' her son on the channel, I won me a Grammy
And mansion I want me a Phantom
My nigga we next up, these niggas, they copy the swag, but no they not better than us

In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
In the hood you earn your stripes, like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me, I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah
Call up on drank and let's, let's call up

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one

You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh

Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the mothafuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make them like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, a.m. to the p.m
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm 'em
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh, trust issues
Oh oh

Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded
Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's...
Let's call up on drank and, uh

All I care about is money and the city that Im from
Imma sip until I feel it, Imma smoke it 'til its done

All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love

And I dont really give a fuck and my excuse is that Im young
And Im only getting older, somebody shoulda told you

She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well baby girl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her

I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one

Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'mma get that shit
Cause Im on one, fuck it Im on one
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one

Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number 2
Cause I popped one

Fuck it I popped one
Trust issues

You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
Oh

Do you know what's going on over here

Have you even bothered to look?

Well if you know, then let me know
We don't gotta be running in these circles
In these circles
No more
Trust Issues

Drizzy Drake, check me out

Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you, in you
Woah, trust issues
Trust Issues

Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
Chorus: 
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range, Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..
Chorus: 


Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, "Accept yourself"
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

I never commented on Yeezus for my interview portion of Rolling Stone. They also took my cover from me last minute and ran the issue

I'm disgusted with that. RIP to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. All respect due. But the press is evil
I'm done doing interviews for magazines. I just want to give my music to the people. That's the only way my message gets across accurately

Yeah, more, yeah

More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star playermy mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a "not guilty"
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, "This what we need to be on," but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, "What have you done for me lately?"
"I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest."
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

Yeah Man 
You already know what it is 
Trey called Trigga 
Aye man 
Show them why you rappin' homie 
Look

I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta maana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog

I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog


Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see it straight
Uh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth -- that's right, I fucking said it
The living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know, how'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin' bitches, bitches
And rappin', rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
I swear, it's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 

Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in won't get me paid
And if I dont do nothing, I'mma ball
I'm counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah, I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 

Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havent slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed
To go our separate ways, so Im single
Thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby dont hold on too long cause thats how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you cant escape me do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, Im learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But Im good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
Im lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where Im headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

Im just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing


This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say "for life" y'all say "forever"
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon' get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so Ima need a thug wife
Yeah, Im talkin' his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, Im talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
Same shit in them streets, so what's the dilly?
Young done everything in the A but fuck Chilli
So welcome to my life: no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life her name's the game

Im just ridin' 'round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I just really hope that 
I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing, I'm doing my thing


Got this top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got em lil brah, unforgettable
Youll never forget this, ya understand me?
Timeless homie, unforgettable


My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sara Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you bad enough that you don't even really need it
You could show at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your possie partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your virgin island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin'
Screamin'

I Got To Be Unstoppable

My name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bar's surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over stand me, I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandanna
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit like A la-la-lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I pick that pussy better, better than her gynecologist
Ho just, text me whenever you want some more dick, more dick
Old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damnnnnn, all I got is one dick

I Got To Be Unstoppable

Oooh
Oooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah

Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying "you should quit", cars saying "fuck your life"
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kindawait, waitfixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch thatsweepstakes
 Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like "yes" and you like "no"
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch 
Aww, aww, aww
Aww yeah we in this bitch
Aww, aww, aww

I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww
TBA

Yeah
Uh-huh

Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, Whose Line is it Anyway?
I'm in the daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been a blaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to ya life

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mayne, this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagga supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And mutha-fucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'mma start shootin in a moshpit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout
Young Mula, baby

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on


Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker
Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeahsound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to 
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to 
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to 
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the woes
I'm home now, I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times
To play games with 'em, I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her
In the same sentence, I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino, promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied togethermotherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this? How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions? We ain't doing no interview!

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends 
We don't love no girls from the ends 
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again

What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the "Are you here?" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

Bu kaltaklar bir zenciden ne ister?

Biraz DMX olayndaym
Eski sevgililerime grup mesaj atyorum

Ve bunlar gerekler

Uh, yea, get in my Slick Rick mode
N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a

Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a...
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it
I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill

Video girl
Eh yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
Accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh
And she beautiful and honey dances
And you always downtown making money transfers
And anything the color of braces she get excited
She always showing up at these places she get invited
She a video girl

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesays, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
"It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait"
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Samples: Why Can't We Live Together by Timmy Thomas


You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, where Jen and Melissa

Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit aint my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when Im lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When Im lonely, when Im lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebodys yacht, that you didnt buy
Youre young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, Im not here to judge
Fuck it, Im not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

But name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when Im lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When Im lonely, when Im lonely

This shit aint my fault


Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast 
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no 
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine

Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no 
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine

Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!
Take Care of the business, nigga 
Give these niggas the business, nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas
OVO YMCMB 
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That YMCMB shit, nigga; flashy lifestyle
One hundred

The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins. We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Got damn I'm shittin' gold these days

Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'ma just hand her a business card and say "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

If they with me, just know that they wit' it and 'bout it
If I said it, I meant it, it's no way around it
OVO, Reps Up, and P. Reign is next up watch Gway go crazy
When Baka came home for the holidays, I was like "Nigga we made it!"
And all of those lawyer fees, nigga I paid it
My family get all of my loyalty, all of my patience
My life for your life, man I wouldn't trade it
I would just look at you dead in yo' face and say "Nigga we made it!"
I swear that we made it, sell out that ting, I'm the king in Jamaica
But I've been on that wave, that's why this year I tell yah, I don't need no favors

And my resolution for New Years is nigga we made it!
You don't know how long I waited, I coulda been waitin' on tables, my karma's amazin'
I'm out in the Caymans, rented a 12-bedroom house just to sleep all the women we came with
That's ignorant, ain't it? Sometimes I question myself when I think 'bout the pictures I painted
Then I pick up my brush and I sign at the bottom like "Nigga we made it!"

Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

I remember standing in the hood
Tellin' my partner, and my momma, everything gonna be all good
Nigga we made it! Damn, I'm up in Las Vegas
Damn, I never was supposed to have shit, now my life is lavish
Every night, fuckin' a bad bitch, nigga we made it!
Coppin' a Lambo, cash, the Bentley, 2 times I crashed
Ha, nigga we made it!
Look at them niggas' faces, them niggas, they hate it
I look a nigga in his face and say "Nigga we made it!"
Soulja Boy stunt on them haters
And these days I don't need no favors
Nigga we made it!

One of dem onesright
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza
Cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, "What are those?"
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit aint how it always seems when its so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I wantyeah, that's right, yeah
What if I kissed you right now
How would we explain it
Trying to imagine how it might sound
If I just yelled out
What if I kissed you right now
Would it bring us any closer
Take the weight off our shoulders
Take me I'm yours
And I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret how long could you keep it
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine 
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine 
And you just be mine.. all mine
What if I kissed you right now...
Would it bring us any closer
Take a weight off of our shoulders
Tell on me
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie...
...admit that I'm yours
I don't really care who knows it
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions
If we were a secret
Tell me could u keep it?
Keep it your yourself don't tell nobody else
Something away
*mumbles* away
Something away
With you... you...
And you just be mine 
And you just be mine.. all mine
And you just be mine 
And you just be mine.. all mine
What if I kissed you right now
What if I kissed you right now
Just be mine 
And u just be mine.. all mine
And u just be mine 
And u just be mine.. all mine

Yes
I'm on that old switch lane shit
Jay, Biggs, Dane shit
Talking about them niggas that my daddy pitch came with
Cause I never learned the "biz" i learned the language
Well spoken, Man i should've went to Cambriege
And momma would always claim this:
"I never expected the outcome"
But one day I became this
Famous
No longer nameless
More gain
But Im the same
I will remain this
I'm still focused
I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 laws if you never read it
Cuz that is one of the main reasons I'm level headed
Despite the accumalated success
If my attitude that was straight I made a regress
I never want to win the lottery only because my uncle told me
"He who made it by struggling, made it the best"
So with that on my chest
I'm down on my last 12 G's
Going through my closet thinking:
"I should probably sell these"
Chanel C's, and LV's
Somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all
Who needs anymore?
Who's satisfied doing good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore?
Who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me
That should have my whole race shook
Cause we don't read novels
But we do face book
The new craze is having that new age look
If I said I liked it I'd feel like a 2 faced crook
Nah
I tell retro kids:
"Tie that bandana just a little bit tighter til it suficates you biter"
Cuz i dont wear bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G my daddy was in the dope game

Yes

I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me "He who made it by struggling made it the best"
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook
Nah, I tell retro kids tie that bandana just a little bit tighter
'Til it suffocates you, biter
Cause I don't wear no bright colors or rope chains
I'm a G, my daddy was in the dope game

High rollers what's up
Dreams Houston what's up
Onyx whats up
You does it baby you does it baby
Harlem Knights whats up
Treasures whats up
Legends whats up
Just love me baby just love me baby
Yeeeeeah
To all my Houston Texas country muffins
Baby let me hit that liquor and that blunt you puffin
And after that Imma throw that fucking young money up
And we can both watch and fall like its bungee jumping
Man Im so high, next time we won't smoke all of that ounce you buy
Oooh, I almost forgot to blow them candles out
Cause I dont really want to fall asleep and light this house on fire
Goodnight, Im still up, I told my girl to lay down
I see the bottle is full, Im bout to drink it way down
What up Bun my nigga
Man you know we stay down
And Im an honoray resident in UGK town
Im on my way
Yeah Im on my way
I never give a fuck about what any nigga say
The music all slow and the bitches all pretty
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city in this thing

What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what up

Money by the Ton
Bricks from Crumbs
Millionnaire from nothing
Mind on hustlin
Pussys a commodity but dick sell better
Em dickies and high shoes to a cashmere sweater
Paint that got wetter than it was in 94
The drink that got thicker and the dirt weed rolled
96 Impala with the stick on the floor
Now its Bentely Four Doors with Patron on the Doors
Light wood nigga Polo fuck Hilfiger
Jammin Slim Thug, Belly fully of drugs
Young hard nigga, underdog nigga
Yellow Lights on the Masa 
Yellow diamonds on my finger
Playing in the car
My dick wanna fuck but my pockets say stop

I need some more dough Ima PIMP for sure

What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what up

Well its the Trill OG
I got the neighbourhood soul
Kush is dead Im getting blowed
Riding bangin getting throwed in the candy painted low
Chrome grill in front of it
Belts on the back of it, my homie shoes running it
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the king cover
Dont care what anybody say long as the King love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her
I just keep on gripping grains dripping stains
Being trilla ain't another brother realer
Blowing thousand dollar killer
With the Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chincilla
In the rari doing donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cellar
Your girl up in the second automatics for the fellas
You see us in the back than all you gotta do is tell us

What up, what up
H Town in this bitch
What up, what up
Me and Pimp about to do it for the city
What up, what up
What up, what up

 when you gotta be like, you know
I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now you know
But I just, I just tell myself this one thing

It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My 16s should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna' make all my goals for the future come overnight
God-god-god-god damn how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl
With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay
Reading all them pro black pro female books
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine
Being cool ain't enough homie I'mma freeze time
Like that


I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I cant believe were finished
My life is movin fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I cant put this behind me
I thought you wouldve called by now, by now
You couldve had my all by now, by now
Its been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question

I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

I swear I heard you call
But when I heard you'd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
I'm steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you wouldve called by now, by now
You could have all my love right now, by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
That's why I'm asking this question...

I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

I can't go to bed
I'm thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go?
Why am I in bed alone?
How come when I drive by, it looks like you are never home?
Do you even live there?
Or did you take a U-Haul?
Too far, move off and not even tell me that you're gone?
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off, burnt out
I kept straight, but I wonder how you turned out

I wonder whatever became of you
Although, It's not that I'm surprised, It's not I didn't try
It's not that I was frightened, of you
Although, I said all goodbyes
And, you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you

Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldnt even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin hes feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasnt really around when it wasnt appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in

What girl that wasnt me whos verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I dont forget the past
And you gave me nothing so Im gonna give you nothing right back, like

Where were you when I...
Woulda loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny Im the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was

Young, dumb, looking in the mirror
Trying to figure out who Im gonna be this year
Its funny you managed to be around for the present
All puns intended your funds are mended
If I take back the cheddar it'll better for both us
No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie Im far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasnt in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line
Ah

Where were you when I...
Woulda loved the person you trying to be now
Its funny Im the dude you trying to see now
Where were you when I
..was past out, cash drought, assed out
I know you here now but
Where were you when I was

Yeah, oh no, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Haha, yeah

Uh, wassup?
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get alot of money you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So and so just walked in... so what?
I don't really vibe with alot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depend how I feel on that night
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend, bitch better have my tomb right
Ah, this is perfect for the women that I loved before
I love em all, I just love me more


It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you

Yeah, I can't get enough of you, babe
Bottles open up so you can try and open up for me, baby
M.I.A. in the M.I.A
You do you, girl, the haters gon' hate
Cut them off like you a sensei, girl
Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah
I'm with you

Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh

It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you

Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior


It's a celebration clap, clap BRAVO !
Lobster & shrimp & a Glass of Mescado
For the girl who's a student & her friend who's a model finish the whole bottle
& we gonna do it big like this... Yeah & he was just practice he ain't in your world you could take him of your atlas. Girl your on fire, Can I be the one you match with ? i'll give you a credit card & Baby you could max this OUT ! Show me were your tats is, show me were your hands at maybe I could grasp it. They say if you get her you could understand her better, & she known to be a Cheater but that's only if you let her. Yeah & I got it together, So when they talk & try to Detour me it's like whatever. Tell 'em I appreciate the help. But I just got to know for myself

Would you love me, if I didn't sing any songs ? if I couldn't take you home ? Would you love me, if I couldn't buy you things ? shoes & diamond rings ? Would you love me if I spent my life, with the same old 9 to 5 ? Would you love me, if I couldn't give it all to you ? Would you love me if I didn't say, Baby you look fly today ? Would you love me if we can't Break away, Take you on a Holiday  ? Would you love me, if I Said things I don't mean ? would you leave or Stay ? Would you lovee me ? I say maybe. If it goes wrong would you just leave me ? Now would you lovee me ? I say maybe, if it goes wrong, would you stay or would you go ? would you love me ?

This life style is vile, The shit will damage ya, Especially when you think No ones understandin' ya. these girls prove with their over protective Managers, Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin' their cameras. Snap, snap, snap til there running out of card space, you remind me of Tony's sister on Scareface just take it easy on love and slow your heart rate. Goodness gracious, the top is just a hard place. Yeeah but if you never even been there, it kinda make sense' why you diein' to pretend there. Spillin' all your drinks, takin' pictures in your swim-wear. Head up in the clouds, you surviing on thin air.  I know that shit is exhaustin' girl, and your mistakes are Costin' girl, and maybe ll dont need the help but I just gotta see for myself...
x2
Girl would you loveee me I say maybe, If it goes wrong would you just leve me ? now would you love mee ? I say maybe, If it goes wrong would you stay, or would you go ?...

Baby everybody love a Summer day. But can you trade the sun for just a Rainy day ? in the Darkest hour would love find its way ?


I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, "It's yours"
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

Listen, girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?

From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my

Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all break through
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it's suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?

From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, she my
My yamaha mama
Ay, ay, be my

I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I'm honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not 
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it's filled up with hot garbage

As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It's hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town

As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I'm not a rapper it's not cause I am
It's cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin'
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
Or watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like I 
We don't like no  nada
Rappin' ass actor until you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario

As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

You know you know
You know you know

Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in 02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

You know you know
You know you know

Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and dont get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that 62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isnt what the motive is
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

You know you know
You know you know

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who"
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice

You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price

You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life
To be completed

Alright, this is it right? We are rolling and we're recording, let's begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music.  Long time coming man.  Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...It's 40's spot, where the music gets made.
40's...uh  what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40's creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know he's always...he's always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So he's been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.
When you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah  And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?
I was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasn't built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably "Back to Back" ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....That's how you, uh, that's how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first...  On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow.  that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.
I mean, you know, just...  Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, that's it.  How many visitors really...I mean I know there's a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, we're tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when it's, when it's... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.
Yeah, I don't really. I'm not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I don't want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing that's tough when you invite people in the studio...is they're obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.
And...and it doesn't always happen every night.  You know...it's not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, there's nights of frustration, there's nights of nothingness, there's night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I don't want to notice you, and that's not to be offensive,  I just don't want to know that you're here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about people's feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing  the album's done It's done. 40 sent it while the game was on. It's crazy, I mean we're literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm.  I think the line was  from Noel was "right now we've been finished for seven seconds." Yeah hahahahaha.
Vincent like came in, he was like "but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, we've been finished for seven minutes." And he want to his computer and he was like "ah, I never sent it."  The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, it's synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent that's your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.
Now...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely.  Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadn't done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?
I think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of it's own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah.  Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...we're...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like it's crazy that you say two years cause t really doesn't feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like "oh man, well you know, I'm gonna do a mixtape."
Just cause I'm just like at this place, where I'm..I'm in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so that's kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then I'll move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if it's me and 40...it's never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in.  We really lock in  ...yeah.  and we take it very seriously and it's not... it's not like some rush job, you know? We...we, we'll sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we don't even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me...  It seems to me,  that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. They've been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They weren't just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.
Well, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If You're Reading This It's Too Late....  It's crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes  and I feel like that's like a...that's a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, it's like, why not? You put all this time  and they're all original sounds, why should shouldn't it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean...  It's focusing your audience, isn't it  ultimately?  Yeah and that's really what it's about right now, is, is...and that's, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what we've been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...it's like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.
Uhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like "Wake up surprise, here's a Drake record" and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?
Uhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, it's...it's great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where we're...we're at today. And then...and then from that, I mean, I ended up going to Atlanta and sitting with Future for six days and he's just a...  a monster  ...he's a machine, it's crazy, I've never seen anybody with that much of a catalog...like I mean, songs that I still think about to this day that I heard in that studio, that I'm like "when is that coming out?"
Oh, I've seen him...I've seen people loading projects

Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If Im in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And Im neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
Ima do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you cant touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Dont cry for me this aint motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isnt at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like

Ok ok Im grown, Im grown
Party at my house but Im home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldnt condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
Im up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said Im up too high somebody get me down down down down

Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
Im much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that Id rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl

Ok ok Im grown, Im grown
Party at my house but Im home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldnt condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE

Thank you very much. Thank you. First of all, I really do apologize for swearing. I just... this means... George Michael, I love him, it means a lot to me, so I'm really sorry if I offended anyone anywhere
Everyone, this is Greg Kurstin. Give it up for Greg Kurstin. Thank you very much for this award. Thank you to the Academy, thank you to my record labels XL and Sony, thank you to my manager, Jonathan. I always get so nervous... And I'd like to thank Greg, because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me. And I was really hard work this record, had a very short attention span, and he would come to me in England so that I didn't have to leave my son, and yet you would leave your son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I've ever done. So thank you, Greg

...Thank you to my mom and dad...
Thank you for the time I've been given
Thank you to everybody for your love and kindness, for your honesty and persuasion

I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
Quand y s' ramne la bouche en cur
En m' disant "Toi, mon p'tit bonheur
Qu'est-ce que j' t'adore !"
Moi, j' ferme les yeux et c'est parti
Le bouche--bouche  l'infini
On est d'accord
{Refrain:}
Bernique, oh, bernique
Nous deux, a colle, mme si tu...
Bernique, oh, bernique
Nous deux, a colle, mme si tu piques
J'aime ses lvres autocollantes
Sa jolie fabrique  bcots
Et sa langue un p'tit peu velcro
Quand elle me fricasse le museau
Et qu' a m' fricotte dans la soupente
Il est Superglu, Scotine
Et moi, j' dcolle  toute berzingue
a fait des apoplexies dingues
Qui m' remuent tout dans mon bastringue
Quand y m'embrasse et qu'y m' butine
{au Refrain}
Ah, c' que j'aime la bouche adhsive
De mon pot d' colle et d' ma ventouse !
Toutes mes copines, elles sont jalouses
D' la manire dont nos lvres s'pousent
Avec la bave et la salive
C'est le baiser de la limace
Si vous trouvez a dgueulasse
Moi, j' m'en dlecte
Et tant pis si a vous dbecte
{au Refrain}
Et si un jour il se dbine
Qu'y veuille plus qu'on soye  la colle
Qu'il aime plus m' lcher les babines
Ou qu'il en pince plus pour ma fiole
J' lui en colle une dans sa bobine
{au Refrain, x2}
Nous deux, a colle, mme si tu piques {x2}
Smack !

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end
And its been waitin' for you to open up yours too
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm takin' these chances and gettin' nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around
And I will do until I find myself with you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

If fish swam out of the ocean and grew legs and they started
Walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky and my tears rolled into
The ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why you even set my world into
Motion
'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I looked up into the grey sky and see a thousand eyes
Staring back
And all around these golden beacons I see nothing but black
I feel a way of something beyond them
Don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation then most of my life isn't
Real
'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here then I don't want to be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh
'Cause if you're not really here then the stars don't even
Matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear but it's all just a
Bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here then I don't wanna be
Either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
If you're not really here then I don't wanna be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Moi, j' mets du bleu  mes paupires
Avant d'aller au bal
a domine sur le planisphre
En gnral
J' suis qu'une fleur bleue
Un myosotis
Mais mes bas bleus
S'arrtent aux cuisses
Moi, j' mets du blues  mes manires
Pour avoir un peu mal
a fait joli dans l'atmosphre
En gnral
J' suis pleine de bleus
Et d' cicatrices
Je fais d' mon mieux
Mais l' terrain glisse
{Refrain:}
Ultramarine ou turquoise
Y m' faut du bleu sur mon ardoise
Azur de cuivre, indigo
Y m' faut du bleu. Moi, a m'enivre
Ce cocktail curaao
Du bleu, du bleu, partout j'en sme
Fragile comme un verre de Bohme
Monochrome comme un baume
De mthylne
Je passe au bleu tout ce qui m' drange
Ma terre est bleue comme une orange
Un peu Matisse
Et j' pousse le vice
Quand je choisis mes amoureux
J' prends des novices
Des p'tits bleus
Un peu trop verts mais dlicieux
{au Refrain}
Le jour o je ferai la bleue
O j'irai  mon dernier bal
J' voudrais qu'on mette un coin d' ciel bleu
Avec moi, sous la pierre tombale
Et des fleurs bleues
Des myosotis
Forget-me-not
Salut la miss
Sur la blue note

When did it go wrong? I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down? I go round and around
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking? I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

Oooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh, I thought I'd die in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go?

Hope you know, I won't let go
Bonjour la Vie
Moi, j'ai que'qu' chose  t' demander
 mon avis
C'est pas gagn
Je voudrais un mari
Pas trop mal boutiqu
La vie qu'est bien mignonne
M'envoie un beau garon
Joli comme un camion
Fier comme un ascenseur
Mais, la Vie, y a maldonne
Il est bien trop bcheur
Au seuil de notre idylle
Il me sort tout de go
Que'qu' chose de rigolo
Du fond d' son pantalon
En m' disant "T' fais pas d' bile
Au lit, j' suis l' roi des champions"
Je ne mange pas de ce pain-l
Rangez vot' tralala
a fait dsordonn
Il a l'air si fragile
Vous l'abmeriez
C'est du toc
De qui se moque-t-on ?
Dans son froc
C'est qui ce mecton ?
Allez hop !
Dgage l'horizon
P'tit con !
Bonjour la Vie
J'ai encore que'qu' chose  t' demander
 mon avis
C'est toujours pas gagn
J' veux un nouveau chri
Mais mieux que le premier
La Vie qu'est bien mignonne
M'envoie un nouveau mec
Moins australopithque
Que le premier bcheur
Toi, la Vie, tu m'tonnes
Je t'aime  toute vapeur
Au seuil de notre amour
Au lieu d' faire l'imbcile
Y m'a sortie en ville
Dans son joli camion
Et m'a dit sans dtours
"Toi, t'es chouchou, dis donc"
Ce garon est bien plus adquat
Holalalalala
Je devrais hsiter
Mais son joli profil
M'invite  l'essayer
Il est top !
C'est qui ce garon ?
Dans son froc
Il est trop mignon !
Allez hop !
Envoie les violons
 fond !
Bonjour la Vie
Je viens encore te rembter
T'es pas ravie
J' suis vraiment dsole
Faut m' changer mon mari
Il est tout z'abm
La Vie qu'en avait marre
De mes rclamations
 propos des garons
M'a jete sur les roses
Maintenant, j'ai le cafard
Je me sens toute chose
C'est vraiment pas marrant du tout
Si on peut pas jouer
Sans risquer d' les casser
La vie est mal fichue
Pour ce qui est des poux
Je m'en suis aperue
L'avis du commissaire
C'est d' me mettre au violon
Car ce pauvre garon
Il est tout flagada
J'y ai fait des misres
Il est mort !

I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love
But if I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I'd end up with you

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?


You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool

And even in the daylight when your gaming

I try to look for thing I hear but my eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt her figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any seams
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?
I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun
I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh
In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby

So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but Im tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Dont get so close to change my mind

Please wipe that look out of your eyes
Its bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, its tiring

This love has dried up, and stay behind
And if I stay Ill be alive
Then choke on words Id always hide
Excuse me, first love, but were through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

Forgive me, first love, but Im too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times

For everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart

{Allo}
Allo, c'est moi je me demandais
Si aprs toutes ces annes, tu voudrais qu'on se voit pour
Faire le bilan
On dit que le temps est cens gurir
Mais je ne m'en suis pas trop remise
Allo, peux-tu m'entendre ?
Je suis en Californie rvant de qui nous tions
Lorsque nous tions plus jeunes et libres
J'ai oubli comment c'tait avant que le monde tombe 
Nos pieds
Il y a une telle diffrence entre nous
Et un million de kilomtres
Allo depuis l'autre ct
J'ai d appeler un millier de fois
Pour te dire, je suis dsole, pour tout ce que j'ai fait
Mais quand je t'appelle tu ne sembles jamais tre l
Allo depuis l'extrieur
Au moins je peux dire que j'ai essay
De te dire que je suis dsole, d'avoir bris ton cur
Mais a n'a pas d'importance, clairement a ne te dchire

Allo, comment vas-tu ?
C'est tellement typique de ma part de parler de moi je suis
Dsol, j'espre que tu vas bien
As-tu russi  t'enfuir de cette ville o il ne se
Passait jamais rien?
Ce n'est pas un secret
Qu'il nous reste  tous les deux peu de temps
Allo depuis l'autre ct
J'ai d appeler un millier de fois

Mais quand je t'appelle tu ne sembles jamais tre l
Allo depuis l'extrieur

Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I can't bear this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

There will be times well try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I, I'm willing to take the risk

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Oh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronise
Don't patronise me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, yeah
I close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel when you're home with me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, these final hours
I will lay down my heart, I will feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me when you don't
When you don't, you
When you don't, yeah

Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love


Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you

Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us, miles between us
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
Then kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Baby, don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder, baby
It only makes it harder, baby
Harder baby, harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
Baby, give me light

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
Un pays couleur de neige
O le blanc joue ses arpges
Un dcor  contre-jour
Dans la bulle de nos amours
Rien de plus, c'est l'amour nu
Un sourire en clair-obscur
Un mot doux, dans un murmure
 l'heure de nos rendez-vous
Une main sur mon genou
Rien de plus, c'est l'amour nu {x2}
Un lit  peine entrouvert
Silencieux comme un hiver
Un frisson quand on se touche
Et des flocons sur nos bouches
Rien de plus, c'est l'amour nu
Un souffle sur mon paule
Un paradis que l'on frle
Allongs dans les arpges
D'un amour couleur de neige
Rien de plus, c'est l'amour nu {x2}
Et dans ma main qui t'crit
Dans les mots que j'ai choisis
Rien de plus que l'amour nu

I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love, "open up your heart"
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me

Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 
Lay me down 

Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

      
         
          
         
     
 
     
          

      
     
   
      
....    

          
        
           
           
   
         
      
    

      
     
   
      
....    

       
    
    
       
    
    
    
    


         
     
   
      
....    
    

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you

I'll always love you
Cause I love you
Love, love
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you havent made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
Id go hungry, Id go black and blue
Id go crawling down the avenue
No, theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rollin sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You aint seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnt do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

Right under my feet is air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing, they melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing, you've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me there

Well I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one
In love, I'm the only one in love


I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay and bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends, I miss my mother
I miss it when life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now in the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends, I miss my mother
I miss it when life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer, my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor

Walking with each other
Think we'll never match at all
But we do, but we do, but we do, but we do
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do
But we do, but we do, but we do
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
In this situation, I'll be glad to make an exception

You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer, my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor

Walking with each other
Think we'll never match at all
But we do

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door, yeah
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

I just need you now
Oh, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you now
I just need you now

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling


There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems
No doubt that will almost fall apart
Than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough

You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no

Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I still try to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait to make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh, so that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd have made
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest


You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say and lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me whichever road I choose, you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared
Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm, to hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So i can start to begin what's begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart, it came to life
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars

But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth and I will always love you
Love you, oh

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see that I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see that I will be, I will be
I will be your remedy
Ohhh, ohhh


Who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes, and you're on your own
You can say, "I chose to be alone"
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down?
You give up everything you are
And even then, you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of 

Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then
When we were both right, and no one had blame
But now, I give up on this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain?
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes, and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain?
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile of
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of

No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now, I've had enough of love

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I would rather say it now incase I never get the chance

No I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea
River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your ship  bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat


Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared


The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow


We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all, it all


We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat


We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure she's got it all, but baby is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you and boy she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumour


Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me and boy you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bare to hear
Just cause I said it, it dont mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just cause I said it dont mean that I meant it
Just cause you heard it

Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 
Rumour has it 

But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for

Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising 
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down 
Mmm, there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready

If you're ready, are you ready?

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready

If you're ready, are you ready?

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better

Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
Cause I knew that there was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
Cause I knew that there was the last time, the last time!

Oh oh ohhhh
Let it burn
Oh oh ohhhh
Let it burn
Let it burn

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

With your loving, there ain't nothing that I can't adore
The way I'm running with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all along

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
You're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope of everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion

Didnt I give it all? Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didnt I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to, well having me around
Still how can you walk away from all my tears?
Its gonna be an empty road without me right here

But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing gets better than this
And this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it?
Youre giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do is all for you

But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all
Take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love

Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And youre in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

I should have known

Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
The trick me back into them

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I cant give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I cant give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
Ill be my own saviour when the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
Ill be my own saviour, standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't rescue you to just desert me
I cant give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning, no

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if Im not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song






It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
Cause I guess I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young






Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

Its above and beyond me, its out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, inside of my head
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, inside of my head
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, the start of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?

In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can barely see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again,  Ill be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left



Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stength00
But I'm stronger now

You'll never see me again  Ill be better in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again

Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wondering the desert for a thousand days
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

The stars are burning, I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning, like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here
I can't explain, but day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

I know I'm not there for you or there when you call
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend

I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

And oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality
Oh baby let's make reality, actuality, a reality

Oh, oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no
Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

... 

You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos
Low life in this high too
You give me love with an attitude
I throw the drink and the glass through
I see your ex and some brand new
I pack my bags and I'm leaving you

'Cause you've been nothing but bad news, bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
No one to blame, you're bad news
It's such a shame, you're bad news
I had it good for bad news

You took me under
Fuck me right over
Do what I had to
You knew I'd come back to you, baby

You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos
Low life in this high too
You give me love with an attitude
I throw the drink and the glass through
I see your ex and some brand new
I pack my bags and I'm leaving you

'Cause you've been nothing but bad news, bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
No one to blame, you're bad news
It's such a shame, you're bad news
I had it good for bad news

You got my eye, and I'm trying to holla at ya
You're walking by, and I trip on the furniture
I'm on a ride that won't stop moving
And I don't know exactly what I'm doing
I see you shake, shake, and I'm spinning
It's like I won a win race, yeah, I'm winning
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

'Cause there arent nothing to it 
Just got to do it 
You got to own it, own it
Party to the beat of your own drum
When it's hot like that 
Party to the beat of your own drum
When you got it like that 
"Eh-eh", yeah
Gotta make ya say, "eh-eh", yeah
So, bang a drum 
Bang a drum

You got me floating ten feet off the ground
It's like "whoa"
I'm up, and I can't come down
My heart's pumping, it's working overtime
I got the crazy butterflies
We're doing it right when we we're together
With you by my side, it don't get better
With you on my team got it figured it out
It's you and me
No doubt

'Cause there arent nothing to it 
Just got to do it 
You got to own it, own it
Party to the beat of your own drum
When it's hot like that 
Party to the beat of your own drum
When you got it like that 
"Eh-eh", yeah
Gotta make ya say, "eh-eh", yeah
So, bang a drum 
Bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum

You got my eye, and I'm trying to holla at ya
You're walking by, and I trip on the furniture
I'm on a ride that won't stop moving
And I don't know exactly what I'm doing
I see you shake, shake, and I'm spinning
It's like I won a win race, yeah, I'm winning
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

'Cause there arent nothing to it 
Just got to do it 
You got to own it, own it
Party to the beat 
When it's hot like that 
Party to the beat of your own drum
If you got it like that 
"Eh-eh", yeah
Gotta make ya say, "eh-eh"
So, bang a drum
Bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum
Bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum
Yeah, bang a drum
Turn it up, bang a drum

I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Im burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Im burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

Im burning up, burning up, youre right there
Your body heat right next to me
Im burning up, burning up, youre right there
Your body heat right next to me
We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
Cause baby, that's why I came

All I need is your body heat right next to me
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat right next to me
Im burning up baby, all I want is your body heat
Burning up burning up, so give it up give it up
All I need is your body heat

Mom always said that books could take you to another world
But I don't think that this is what she meant

I'm shuttling through these distant lands and ocean shores
Don't really know where I'll go next
'Cause I've been...

Brain Zapped
Lets go explore
Brain Zapped
To a whole new world
Brain Zapped
Come be my guest
Brain Zapped
Don't know where I'll go next

My mind is spinning around
Got all this knowledge
I just want to shout out
Got to get it under control
Because the light is green, and we're ready to go


Brain Zapped
Lets go explore
Brain Zapped
To a whole new world
Brain Zapped
Come be my guest
Brain Zapped
Don't know where I'll go next

Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I can't seem to hide from the lies
I can't disguise myself
I've build these walls so high
And I can't climb myself

And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now

They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

I can't seem to choose what to do
There's nothing I can say
I'm tired of the fight 'cause I'm never right
I just wanna cry, no

And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now

They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

When the world is yours
And it's mine's and it's your's

When the world is yours
And it's mine's and it's your's


They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

They can't steal our love

There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil

The curl of her lips
The ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

This vampire bat
This inhumane beast
She oughta be locked up and never released
This world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil, yeah!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize you've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock

Cruella, Cruella De Vil

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill, oh

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil


Cruella De Vil, yeah
Cruella De Vil
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Disappear

I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that you'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back like a heart attack
That's always breaking

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

I don't want to be lonely
But you were always the only
One who cast a spell and made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose you
So just do your trick and make it quick
Cause I'm pretending

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

Don't go!

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

You say you don't need me
You say, "this time believe me"
I'm not gonna let you disappear 
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear 

Don't go!

Disappear

Sittin' on my bed with just your t-shirt on
Turning up the volume to my favorite song
Boy, I can't lie, what we did last night
You know it's constantly replaying, staying on my mind

I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy

If I had a choice, if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish and if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
Every single single day

Damn, I wish I didn't feel so hypnotised
When I look at you, baby, it's justified
So I take what I want, and give what I got
To hell with all the rules they keep us civilized

I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy

If I had a choice, if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish and if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
Every single single day

Nowhere I'd rather be than anywhere alone just you and me
I'll be your Tonto, you'll be my Clyde
We'll be together, forever we'll ride
I want you more and more
You're hotter today than the day before
No lie, no lie, no lie, no lie

If I had a choice, if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish and if I had my way
Boy, you know we'd do it every single day
Every single single day

I'll show you what I like, boy-boy-boy
If you show me what you like, boy-boy-boy
I'll show you what I like, show you what I like, like
If you show me what you like, boy

Well, you know everything's gonna to be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease


But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed!


Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not... what it seems

No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
And now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
Our love is hard to find

Do you stay up late just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh
Days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh

When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Through your highs and your lows
Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone

Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh
Days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh

Feel me 
Feel me 
Feel me 

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

Do your days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh 
Days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heartbeat a little bit louder?
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh

Every time your lips touch another
Hah-ah-ah-ah-oh
Every time you dance with somebody

Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you

Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart


Rise to the heights of all you can be

Soar on the hope of marvelous things

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name


Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love
Made to rule the world
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

Album Art:
You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lightening me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell of a trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breatheless moments
Breaking me down down down down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
It wants what it wants



I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what its like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself


Lyrics will be available upon official release. Stay tuned!
Ah
Here, here, here
Higher, higher, higher
I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door

I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar

I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Hey, cause I believe in me, oh
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

Fly  Fly  Fly , Fly
I believe

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar

I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Fly-eye-eye

You're so hot, not
But if I can be honest, baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool, not
But if you didn't notice, you got me playing the fool, with you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

You're so you, ew gross
But there's something about you that's making me feel like I do, with you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will, I'm all about
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Yeah, here, you're here, you're here
Higher, higher, higher, higher

Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam

Tonight, become alive
Stand up, 'cause you got the pride
Dancing, and the sweat don't dry
Once shot, so baby, hit it right
No doubt, 'cause we're young and free
Walk like you run the city
Write your name in the sky
Live it up, 'cause baby, it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself
You gotta know you're something else
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy

Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam

We got nothing to lose
We got nothing to prove
Shine bright, like diamonds in the sky
Live it up, 'cause baby, it's your time

It's in the way you hold yourself
You gotta know you're something else
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy

Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam

Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

In the dark, we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know
In your lips, I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly
When you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Hey babe, it's me. Umm I just wanted to call and tell you that I love you so so so so much. I just wanted to let you know that you are my princess, you are worthy of all of the love in the world. You are the love of my life...

Now's all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember

You said you loved me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
All your promises
And all them plans we had
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

The trips we dreamed of taking, the tacks left on the map
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh
What happened, what happened, what happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love a sunny day
I dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone

I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change

See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

I just want to know what we should have done
Want to figure out what we could have become
Because I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just want to go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

 Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? 
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

1 2 3!
Uh, uh
Ye-ow!



You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

I won't be whining about
What mightn't been
You know Im not too big on giving in
I use whatever spell the law allows
That is of course, if I knew how

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

We're not afraid to fall
Yeah we're going for it all
There's no nothing to our madness
Yeah we're answering the call
If we used a little magic
Well we really can't recall
All I Know is that we're going to
Make it happen
Ye-ow!

Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls



Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know

Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no

If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

All I need is love
Thats what you give
I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
Thats what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are when everything's a lie
All I need is here, right where you are
You're every reason why

Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you

'Cause you set me up on fire
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you
Ever try to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream?
Every step that you take forward
It takes you right back where you been
And then when you least expect it
And you've tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinions
Somebody cares what you see
You woke me up
No longer tired
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fire
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
Oh trying to do it right
No rehearsals
It's your life
If you're doing this crazy dance
Cause your making these crazy plans
T's just this is not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take
On a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They're gonna know your name
When it gets old don't lose the light
You're cold, I'll warm you up
Your fire is hot enough, enough, enough
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Trying everything just to touch your dreams
You look so classic, fantastic
Oh when you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
You're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes
Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you make me new
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT

You're the new classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that

No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can you keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh

Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey! Hey!

You come from here, I come from there
You rock out in your room, I rock a world premiere
We're more alike then anybody could ever tell
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we kick, it and let loose, and LOL

It may seem cliche for me to wanna say that you're not alone
And you can call me uncool, but its a simple fact
I got your back
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down this dream
We're one and the same
Hey! Hey! Hey!
La, La, La, La, La

I'm kinda like you, you're kinda like me
We write the same song in a different key
It's got a rhythm, you and me can get along
]
And it may seem cliche for me to wanna say that you're not alone 
And you can call me uncool but its a simple fact
I still got you're back

Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one in the same

Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're something more than momentary

Cause we're one

Shakin up the scene
We're one and the same

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you

I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah
I know you're loco

They say you shouldnt sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But you're so irresistible
I had to break the rules
Your temper can be sexy
I love it when you hate me

Its out of my hands
Its out of my hands
Its out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know youre loco
Uh oh I know youre loco
Uh oh I know youre loco
But feels too good, yo

They say you shouldnt sleep with
Someone crazier than you
Cr-Cr-Crazier than you
No one's crazier than you
But youre so unforgettable
I had to break the rules
Your eyes are like a weapon
Theyd kill me if I let em

Its out of my hands
Its out of my hands
Its out of my hands
And into your arms again
Uh oh I know youre loco
Uh oh I know youre loco
Uh oh I know youre loco
But feels too good, yo

I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yo
Uh oh, I know you're...

But it feels too good, yeah
Uh oh, I know you're loco
Uh oh, I know you're...
Uh oh, I know you're loco
But it feels too good, yeah

Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

Baby tell me that you need me
Because I'm onto you
Keep on the low I'll be waiting for you
Baby come on me show show what I can do
I can make all come true
Cause I'm onto you
Keep on the low I'll be waiting for
Oh
Were dancing in the red light
I can do it all night
Oh
Its your addiction
We don't need a reason
Closer
Keep on moving closer,closer
Hiding in the shadows of the corner
Oh I'm falling over you
Oh I hope you know
I'll be waiting for you
Oh
Were dancing in the red light I can do it all night
Oh
It your addiction we don't
Need a reason
Baby you don't have to be alone
We can make ur alright
Collide tonight
Oh
We dancing in the redlight
I can do it all night
Its you addiction
We don't need a reason

I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival, revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival

You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air
You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where youre at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And its hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
Itll be alright, theyre just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

Happier times flash through my mind
We both say it's over, and I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we are both to blame
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me

It's a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over
In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade



Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
Im so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 
Im so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
Im so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh 

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I am so sick, I'm hoping you notice, yeah baby
So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why, love's a lie

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
Im so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough

And I don't mean to make you cry baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes
Your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time for you and I

I can't believe that my body is still moving, I
It makes me feel like we're doing something right

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day
D-d-d-d-d-d-day, oh
Save the day

Yeah, we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late
Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight, I

I can't believe that my body is still moving, I
It makes me feel like we're doing something right

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day

Da-oh-ey-oh-ey-oh-ey

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes

Baby, when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy, you keep my heartbeat skipping when you touch me
Even though the time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
Oh, when the night starts slipping away
Save the day

D-d-d-d-d-d-day, d-d-d-d-d-d-day

I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece

She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Kryptonite, so the walls - I done lost my power to see through them bitches

But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision

Don't like waiting, don't like waiting
Let's go right now
Gotta hit the ground, dancing 'fore the music slows down
What I'm saying, what I'm saying
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level, this is the remix

Everybody, everybody get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, till you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up, bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up!

Shake it up

Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me, it's like we go M.I.A
Make a scene, make a scene nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, 'til you rock it
We can't take it no more

Bring the lights up, bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-shake it up
You got to change it up
And if the day's not right, just brush it off tonight
Put on the attitude
Youre in the pocket mood
And when you've had enough, sh-sh-sh-shake it up

Bring the lights up, bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up
DJ set it off, take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up!


Bring the lights up, bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up!
Bring the lights up, bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up, shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up, shake it up!

Shake it up
Shake it up

EP Art:

We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up
That bad kind of love is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together

'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I'm stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name
And never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

Don't be afraid
Close your eyes
Let me take you to places that you've never been tonight
I thought by now you'd realize
I can do anything I put my mind to, ooh

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
Instead of us falling, we're flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just
Stardust

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon
I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars...
I can make, I can make...
I can make the...
I can make the stars dance
The sky is everywhere
So meet me under there
I can make the stars dance
Dance, dance for you, you, you

Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We catch each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors 
We are survivors of the wild

Woahoooo 
Woahoooo 
Woahoooo
We are survivors of the wild
Woahoooo 
Woahoooo 
Woahoooo
We are survivors of the wild

We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors 
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors 
We are survivors of the wild

When I was on, when I was on stage and I was thinking of...
I felt like I know, I know him though
And I know that, and I know his heart
And I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
But I didn't realize that I-I-I feeling so confident
Feeling so great about myself
And then it just be completely shattered
By one thing, by something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy
You make me feel like it's my fault
I was in pain

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

 So

My body feels like chess , no no no it's not stress

When I see my Totem, I remind that I'm not broken

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

I look at you and all I wanna do is just disappear 
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get outta here? 

You're a sexy machine
You're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you...

All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And pull the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark 
And you can navigate me like the map that you know by heart 

You're a sexy machine
You're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd
I want you...

All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And pull the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like the map that you know by heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You dont need no other lover
You dont need no other lover
You dont need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You dont need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You dont need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name
Gonna write your name

Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name

Permanent, leave your scar
When you're gone, you're never far
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Cover me, all you are
Over me, your signature
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart

It's your name across my heart
Written in gold, a permanent mark
Love engraved, it's what we are
More than words, this love is art
Poetry in motion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved

Write your name, across my heart

Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name
You Don't Own Me
-----------------------

You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display
Me & My Girls
-------------------

Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's not you
I'm going home with who I came with
And who I came with's
Me and my girls, me and my girls
You can look, but don't touch
I'm not here to hook up
I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls

Fighting flames with fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it
Yeah, I meant it

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I, I, I, really fucking meant it

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

And I know you say you want it now 
Give me the runaround 
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

And I know you say you need me now 
Give me the runaround 
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?
She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
How can I help it if I like the way she makes me feel it?

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car

We aint ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We aint ever getting older
We aint ever getting older

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but Im okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I cant stop

So baby pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older


We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

Boug en ville dans une voiture en panne
Et quatre ans sans un appel
Maintenant tu as l'air magnifique dans ce bar d'htel
Et je n'arrive pas
Non, je n'arrive pas
Donc Chrie, presse-toi contre moi
 l'arrire de ta Rover
Ce que je sais que tu ne feras pas

Du matelas que tu as vol
De ton ancien coloc de Boulder
Nous ne vieillirons jamais

I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, cause I dont smoke 'gars, babe
Im at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, cant stop
Lets get high, we cant stop
No

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover

We ain't ever getting older
Khalifa man
We ain't ever getting older

Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
Been smoking so long I got my own strain
Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cos you'll never do it again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, cause I dont smoke 'gars, babe
Im at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
And get high, cant stop
Lets get high, we cant stop
No

Droppin' bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hit you all at once
I'm already tired and it's still mornin'
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughin'
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darlin', I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Say you regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're usin'
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

No way, no way you're human

Pause that!
We're in Zurich, at Lausanne and uh
Pausing
Ready?
Yeah, go
This is how the song starts
Hold on, hold on, wait what?
She's got a new song
Okay, before you forget it, go
Okay, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms, qualms, qualms
Qualms, qualms
Thank you, goodnight!

Another weekend since you've been gone
It doesn't feel like it's been that long
But I guess it gets better every day
Yeah, yeah
My head is heavy, my mind is numb
I found myself in a stranger's arms
Cause I just want to make it fade away
Yeah, yeah

My heart is a broken machine
Need you to come set me free
Keep on playing that music baby
Keep on playing that music baby

Erase, erase, erase
Take it all away
Erase, erase, erase

I see you calling and don't respond
And now I feel like I'm right where I belong
And I am ready for a change 
What doesn't kill me will make me strong
Just turn it up, nothing's wrong cause
I can just keep dancing through the pain
Yeah, yeah

My heart has been colder than ice
I feel it come back to life
Keep on playing the music baby
It's all that's getting me through this baby

Erase, ay, erase, ay
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing at all
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing
Erase erase erase
Take it all away
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing at all
I wanna dance till I can't feel nothing

I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be
I promised I'd be good

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be
I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they call, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you 
I promised I'd be

The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart
Woah, woah, woah

It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it

I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else

Bend your chest open so I can read your heart

Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are

I have never wished on hope
Didnt need a telescope to see where I am going
I have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue

All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah

Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah

Born in a broken home, okay
Single momma let me chase what I was made for
We made out the paradise
Build on nickels, rubbing dimes
I'mma turn it to so much more

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the King of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day, like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never 
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never 
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never 
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive

You end up alone after all that you've done
All that you paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone
People don't think you know what you're made of
Oh
Are you better than me?
It's not up to say it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way
I'm seeing it through, can you not be hateful
While we're alive
Can we relax that, that what our maids for?

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it too, I'm trying to follow
I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?  

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

Holding out hope for you
Holding out hope, holding out hope for you

You were there for me, and I was there for you
I remember times like that
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?

Let you go, let you go
Let you go, let you go

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
You think i'm crying on my own well i'ain't

And i'didn't wonna write a song cause i'didn't want anyone
Thinking i still care i dont but maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And i never like to admit that i was wrong
And i've been so craught in my job did'nt see what's going on and now i know i'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much oh baby you
Should go and love yourself and if you think that i'm
Still holding on oh baby you should go and love yourself

When you told me that you hated my friends the only problem was with you and not them,you think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake you think i'm crying on my own well i'ain't
And i did'nt wonna write a song cause i did'nt want anyone
Thinking i still care i dont but maye be you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone and i never like to admit that i was wrong and i've been so craught in my job did'nt see what's going on and now i know i'm better sleeping on my own

You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're
My type
Oh, I hate to say it, but you're

To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I know that look on your face, that I had lost you

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
Cause you love me enough to let go of me

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything

Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ahh
Ahh

Take me back to a time only we knew

When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first
Let me take a selfie

Let me take a selfie

Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever
How about "Living with my bitches, #LIV"
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

Selfie, selfie, let me take a selfie

Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Ok, let's go take some shots
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my god, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

Selfie...
Let me take a selfie
Let me take a selfie

Down to my last match fire
I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Out in the cold you have been

They say that I'm a sick boy
Make no mistake, you live this

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I
Arrive, I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You get real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone

I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone?

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?

We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard

Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times
The times you got back up, woah
Could be a billionaire in a year
That's how you gotta think 'til you're there
On the regular

If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
Youre the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Come again each time
'Til the water runs dry
Oh don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

If I had a guitar missing 5 strings
A guitar with only one string
I could only play one song, ooh
A simple melody
Simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing
You know what I mean

If you had a diamond for all of your passion
Diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like caking
Icy for every occasion
Gotta go hard, yeah
That's all I'm condoning
Love is a component
You're the only opponent
Gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it

Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All in it, all in it

See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognition

I just can't wait, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click

Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

Oh-ho, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own, for my own baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you baby

It's all I want for Christmas baby
It's all I want for Christmas
It's all I want baby, yeah yeah
Woah, woah woah woah woah, ooh baby

Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days when we threw them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
Cause I need you here and I want for you to know

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that
All I want is you this Christmas

And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here, here through the holidays, yeah
I just wanna know if you feel same way
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby

And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you and I want you to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you

All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that

Wrapping gifts without you babe's like mid-December
And there's no cold, I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again, I'm here to stay, yeah

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
Al I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
This Christmas, this Christmas, this Christmas
All I want is you this Christmas
I'm sorry if I hurt you but I know that

It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah

Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone

You can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly

As long as you love me

As long as you love, love me, love me

Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it
I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow 
Camera's pointed shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love me

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress and don't cry

She woke me up daily, dont need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend

Forget about the plans that you got, baby
Kiss me like you can't have too many
The Earth is like 'round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

So in the meantime, I'm living and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love

Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you

Get a little excited from across the room
I just can't seem to keep my eyes off you
Smile at me, so I smile at you
Then you feel so loved, when I dance with you
Tonight the way that you're moving
Make me wanna lose it
Round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know

So in the meantime I'm living, and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above

Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got

La voit dans la rue
Et dans la cour de l'cole,mais je veux vraiment la voir le
Week end
Elle sait qu'elle m'a tourdi parce qu'elle tait
Tellement incroyable

You said I come in peace so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You dont know what theyre like, if they know that youre alive
Theyre gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Dont try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planets outside there waiting, I cant stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didnt have a friend, didnt know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
Youre my best friend please listen to me

You dont know what theyre like, if they know that youre alive
Theyre gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen

Dont try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planets outside there waiting, I cant stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

Greetings, I fell from the sky
Im from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, Im the only one that survived
Ive only taking over this planet since I arrived
Im in a backpack, Im ducking Men in Black
Yeah, Im an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Waynes world


Dont try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planets outside there waiting, I cant stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack

On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

No I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah

But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like woah
It was a bad day, it was a bad day

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night

Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything

Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright

Damn, I miss you

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds, bumps on the road and upside down
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night, don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry
Cause everything's going to be alright
Be alright

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, oh I love you

And everything's going to be alright
Be alright, yeah yeah

Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you

If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you


If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

Believe, believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here, uh
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

There were days when I was just broken
You know, there were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from folding

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Wouldn't know, how it feels, to touch the sky
If you didn't believe, believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

Where would I be if you, yeah, if you didn't believe?
Wouldn't know how it feels to touch the sky, yeah
If you didn't believe, believe, believe
Where would I be if you didn't believe?

It's like every time you fall
No one's gonna lend you a helping hand, oh
Wondering will you spend your life facing four walls
Like standing in quicksand, oh

Don't let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong
I know what you can be cause underneath
You've had wings all along

And you've been travelling the same road for a long time
Feels like you're burning rubber going nowhere fast
I mean to tell you there's no limit to what you can do
You just gotta believe

Where'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken

You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all

I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you

Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken

You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all 

I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you

When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
Im doing better without you, you, you

I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh 
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh 
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh 
Im so much better without you, you, you, you oh 
With you with you oh without you
Julkeyz

The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't ever, ever let you down
Like a see saw let you down
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't push-overs, no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

Remember those stroll down street? 
Don't knock your earrings 
They shine on me 
In class daydreamed about you 
 wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger

I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player when I was little
But now I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, woah

So take a  of moment, you can settle down no
 blowing in the wind
So take a  of moment, you can settle down no
 blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind

We can figure out 
So you've be wasting your time
It ain't fixing your sorrow
Did you say  your light
How do our lives become lighter ?
How do our eyes become brighter ?
You gotta believe in something higher
Why do we really want to gain ?
Why won't we learn to be selfless ?
Wake away from all the shame

So take a  of moment, you can settle down no
 blowing in the wind
So take a  of moment, you can settle down no
 blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind
Blowing in the wind

Shawty so thick she put a dent in my couch
And dent in my wallet, I'm diggin' her probably
I told her let's kick it, karate
Got a black belt on, Versace
Wanna get my eat on, Hibachi
2 Chainz on with a pinky ring

Youngin' gettin' money, all these honeys say they love me
Buddha belly, how I'm lucky, girls be rubbin' on my tummy
I can be your man, get you everything you need
Have you ever had a Rollie, Stewart Weitzman on your feet?
And you can be my queen, couple thousand on the jeans
Cause I'm down to do some spendin' on the women of my dreams
Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin' baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go
Where I'm tryna take you, we gon' need a boat
Independent raps, yeah my life is like the Beatles though
Invest a big check to make sure you get fresh
Cause if I was your boyfriend, I'd treat you like a princess


And we can be like Selena and Biebs
Wild and free, a couple disobedient teens
Sneaking out to meet around like 2 o'clock in the eve

Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good, they try to break me


Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me? I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it


West coast, this ones for you

Hey, my young wanna have some fun
And you can play with my cannon
Oh it is my understanding
That you would like to start webcammin'
What about Facebook? Or Myspace
How would you like to take a look at my face
Isn't it pretty? But so is my cannon
No I'm not done, I am still standin'
Chrome 22's on my grocery cart
Rollin' down the street, tryna find me a heart, to break

Wishing you could be here all the time

I just can't live without you
Coming soon

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

Should I tell her how I really feel?
Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way to far away

Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong

And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah

I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, woah, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I fall in love with you all over again

Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
Tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover

Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That's right I think she foreign, I think she foreign
Got passports, mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time, I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Explosive, explosive
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident

Feels so good damn, and I don't know why 
I'm addicted, something like an addict 
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it 


Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat
Stay faded like Diddy's hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock & roll
She say "I know, honey bunny
That's the funny thing"
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team
IGH!
She's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time, I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it, still I gotta have it, still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no

Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is...

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
But it sure is worth a try
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Basically, I'm staying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me, yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Ay ay ay, oh

It's what you do to me, yeah
Woah, no no no, ooh woah
Baby, please don't go, girl
Don't go, no no no

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
And we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

And mama, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

I never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

What a'gwaan, you know what it is Bieber fever man
Shawty mane, shawty mane, I caught Bieber fever too

Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playing with the sun
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
Nothing to give our king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

At the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realise my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'mma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even want to help at all
Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of yous gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall

What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love? 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all 
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fall

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity

Your glass slippers in my hand right here

Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline

Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different? Just talk to me I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?
She she's leaving, damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

Girl you always catch me at the bad time

I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline, flatline

Girl you always catch me at the bad time

How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline

I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then speak to me

Girl its getting late, the sun's going down
And its about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just want to say
That you stay on my mind each and every day
I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when its building inside, then I cant pretend
No I dont want to fight it, I dont want to hide the way I feel
So I guess its time for me to say

That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

Cause on nights like this
Its good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever

Dont know if it's love, it's too early to say
But if its something like it, I just want it to remain
Dont know if youre the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if its a hint of whats to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward
But I think its best for you to know
 + 

I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then speak to me
I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then holla
I think I found my girl, if its you then speak to me
 +  x2 + 

Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face

I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh

Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you

Forever if I May
'Til your flowers bloom in June

Be your 4th of July
For life
As long as you stand right by my side

Keep growing closer
Throughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebrating

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside the door alone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances when you're down on your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Didn't mean to put your heart at ease, oh
It's true, oh don't lose your self esteem
I apologise, for being a man
It's what happens, don't you see?

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand

We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy

Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
Its gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and youre not there, woah?


Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain


Girl you don't know how I feel, how I really feel
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
If I dialed you today, oh

Girl you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker

Girl you see me standing here, standing here
Standing in the rain, oh baby
Any chance you could stay right here, yeah yeah
And never go away?

Girl you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone
Girl I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
Cause girl my  heart's breaking, heartbreaker

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name
And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm, the way that I'm
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart

Walking on the beat, with my backpack on and my snapback on, with the rap back on, uhuh
Beautiful girls wearing high heels, asking how I feel, I feel I, uhuh

Ever since I met you baby I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have, she's priceless for real oh
You don't ever have to do a thing but give me all your love and affection, oh
You have something going for yourself, that's the type of girl for me

Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

Hey girl, you're something out a magazine
You're something on a movie screen
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Hey girl, you're something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say

Ever since you looked into my eyes nothing seems to phase me, oh
There's no one who ever satisfied, stolen love can make me, oh
Fell the way you do, its something in the way you do
The way you move your body girl

Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

Hey girl, you're something out a magazine

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own

I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
That's a part of living, woah
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah

If only I could hit the ground
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday

Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight

Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Looking out the window waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway, it's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Pacing down the hallway tryna fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop, except for the clock on the wall, yeah yeah
And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight, so we can lay down by the fireside
You and I 'til Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here, I'll be waiting

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here, through the winter snow
Baby think of me
If it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Looking out the window waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway, it's really coming down tonight

I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect

I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one

I'm the one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

Because I'll take you home to mama
I'll let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect

What do you mean it's not like that?
Oh, you're sorry?
Well, where are you now that I need you?
But girl, let me tell you something

I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling

Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much

I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame

Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, its really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?

We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with me

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnt never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

When you was just a youngun youre looks but so precious
But now youre grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you cant have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
Its seems like you came back 10 times over
Now youre sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnt never figure out
How to love
How to love

I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnt never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasnt your fault
Wasnt in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You dont want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so dont be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldnt never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didnt last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

I just want you to know
Snippet

Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me

It's that Abe Lincoln  history in the making
Spirit filled, miseducation
I'm that new Jason Bourne, reborn a revelation
You gon' perfect your gift and I'm gon' perfect my patience
Unashamed to say the name, I keep it blatant in every statement

His name is Jesus and maybe you'll start believin'
I don't boast about numbers but I'ma keep it one hundred
Yeah, it's songs over sins, yeah I put God over money
Yeah, I know my name's Justin but justice is comin' 
Yeah 
Patiently waiting cause I know that soon or later
You'll be ready to understand who I am
Patiently waiting cause I know it will be, know it will be okay
But I'm still at it
Lights, camera, action
Im always keeping busy babe
And I do it cause I have too, I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
And all the things you put me through
Got no time to waste 
I guess we really needed space 
I just wanna know if you want to
Try and understand cause I want you
I just wanna know if you want to
Try and understand cause I want you
I dont want to be with nobody else
If I cant be with you then Im with myself
Figure it out cause I want you now, yes I know
And all the times you tried to stop me
Uhum, it aint working
Confident is not cocky
Uhum, I guess its working
Im staying up till 6 in the morning
Just reminiscing about the past days
This rain just keeps on pouring
And I don't wanna leave it that way
I just wanna know if you want to 
Try and understand cause I want you 
I just wanna know if you want to 
Try and understand cause I want you 
I dont want to be with nobody else
If I cant be with you then Im with myself
Figure it out cause I want you now
Yes i know

Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away
You away, you away
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today
You today, yeah oh

You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby roll up, so hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London  baby we're so down 
Something I wanna say, yeah, you know I'll be there

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart

I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

You're laid out, you were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby roll up, so hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London  baby we're so down

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart


So I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn these seats go way back
I was thinking about way back
When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that we
 no matter what
 no matter what
 no matter what 
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart

My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you

I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

Making out with you, in the open
Under the starry skies in the moonlight
I couldn't think of what was on my mind, cause baby
You're my fantasy
You're my dream
You're my delirium
You're my ecstasy
I'm a fool to be making out with you
When you'll leave me, thinking I'm screwed
It was the first time I saw you
I didn't realize I was already in love with you
You were looking real pretty by yourself
At a coffee table your eyes are full of stories I can tell
So I made you my story
Loved you for who you are
There was something in you I could relate to
You were closer to me even when you were not by my side
You could control me like I was only yours to drive
I'm a fool that I let you
I wanted to leave you so bad
You pulled me over when I thought I could abandon you
Our love didn't have to be so devastating
You could have held my hand longer
I could be your remedy
You could make me fall for you in a blink of an eye

I'm a fool that i fell for you baby
I have to fight for what I love
I have to fight to be with you
I fought the bravest I could to get you
I lost the war i was fighting
I'm a fool that I fought for you baby
I wanted to cradle you and love you forever
But you ran away from me baby and it couldn't be me
You complete me
You are inside my heart
You are the reason I can live
I'm a fool that I gave you this space in my heart and loved you
I questioned myself, over and over and over again
If i couldn't be the one?
Why would I love you?
Why would i make such a fool of myself?
It was your eyes that made me fall for you
It was your eyes that make me love you
Baby, they are the stories I can, oh i can tell
I tried to push you away
I want you in my life even if you pushed me away
I'm a fool that you are so far away from me now

I'm a fool that i fell for you baby
I have to fight for what I love
I have to fight to be with you
I fought the bravest I could to get you
I lost the war i was fighting
I'm a fool that I fought for you baby
You were sitting right in front of me
I knew you were the one for me
I didn't know how to tell you that I loved you
You were trouble from the start
You are the trouble that soothes my heart
You're so beautiful
You should have stayed near
Never away from me
As close to me
There is no expiration day to our love
We could activate charred passions with ours
I made out with you wildly
It's being playing on the TV screen of every store
It's the movie of our love and it's playing live
I can't help it
I'm a fool that i will love you forever
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool for you baby
As a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance
Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended
I'm very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again
Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always what's right
Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once again.... I'm sorry
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!
You don't know
Fix all of your insecurities
Oh oh oh oh
I wanna fix all of your insecurities
You know that I want to
Give you everything that you need
I wanna fix all of your insecurities
I wanna fix all of your insecurities
What are you worrying for
I have been there since day one
Trying to open the door
Cause you know that our friendship has only begun
Im aware of your secrets
You ain't gotta tell me but I can read it
I can see you can swim babe
Cause you're always jumping in the deep end
And I know that I've got something to offer to you
The worlds in your hands
All I want is fix all of your insecurities
Oh oh oh oh
Fix all of your insecurities
You know that I want to
Give you everything that you need
I wanna to fix all of your insecurities
I wanna fix all of your insecurities

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you

Well, tell me is it wrong?
Wrong for me to say this?
That our relationships been rough for a long time
Well baby, do you care?
Care about my heart, babe?
Acting like it's always you
Baby girl, I want to make you
I wanna make you mine

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel the love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

Well I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
You coming here sayin' that you only wanna be friends
I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
When you're down for the week
But then you're gone for the weekend

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby

Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

So when the lights turn off
And this love don't last
There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, I'm starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!
Girl, I know you feel this lust
Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us

Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby

You say you want a better life
I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody's living life with someone they can hold
It must be hard to sleep at night
Believe me girl
I know

I wanna be your lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea
You'll always have a home here with me
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be 
I wanna be , oh
I wanna be 
I wanna be 

You say you want a better life, I know
You're tired of all these party nights with nothing left to show
When everybody is living life with someone they can't hold
It must be hard to sleep at night, believe me girl, I know

I wanna be the lover that you need
I wanna be the shore to your sea
You'll always have a home here with me
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be 
I wanna be , oh
I wanna be 
I wanna be 

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

I would build the love of river wide so that it never runs dry, yeah
Any time you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right, I just can't read your mind, no

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want, it's all about what you need
I know that he hurt you, but that wasn't me
And I know and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That I'm where you need to be, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Oh, t, t eres el imn y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Slo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
Oh, yeah Ya, ya me est gustando ms de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo ms
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningn apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al odo
Para que te acuerdes si no ests conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito


Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ensees a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos

Djame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dmelo
Yo s que ests pensndolo
Llevo tiempo intentndolo
Mami, esto es dando y dndolo
Sabes que tu corazn conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba est buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cmo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cunto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, despus salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando t me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aqu tengo la pieza
Oye!

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al odo
Para que te acuerdes si no ests conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito


Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le ensees a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos

Djame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, "Ay, Bendito!"
I can move forever se quede contigo
Bailalo!

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le ensees a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido

I know its hard but, you know
Lets go

Theres something different in your eyes baby
You cant seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gon' assume that somethings wrong

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just cant do this again
Please dont tell me youre just like them

Please dont tell me youre just like them
Youre just like them

I know that its hard to trust love
But you need the trust that my love
Will never leave you in the dust

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just cant do this again
Please dont tell me youre just like them

Please dont tell me youre just like them
Youre just like them

Baby can we keep this love on track?
We can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what youre waiting for?
You gotta know know know know
Know know know know know know
Know know know know know know

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just cant do this again
Please dont tell me youre just like them

Please dont tell me youre just like them
Youre just like them

Yeah, JB, yeah, woah, no no

Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah
 + 

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies, don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what I give


Kiss and tell, whoa oh, I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell, oh no no no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell, that's not me

Oh, yeah
She's my Latin girl, she's my Latin girl

I was on the beach yeah, I was on vacation
I was doing nothing, I was just sitting patient
Then you walked by, you caught my eye
I said "Who's this girl? She's looking super fly"

Hey miss beautiful, I've never seen you before
And I would like to be the one to show you I am cool enough
Hey little momma, what you got on ya?
Looking so good that I just want to telephone her

She's my Latin girl
Ooh pretty lady, don't you think it's crazy?
She's my Latin girl
Oh she tries to fight it but she knows she likes it
She's my Latin girl
Saltwater seas then she's looking at me
She's my Latin girl
Yeah yeah yeah
 + 

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
Shine on me tomorrow: let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be, let it be

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again
Come, they told me

At the table with the family
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker
Then it gave a lil' flicker then
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!
Mary nodded

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the stand
It's crazy how some people say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you give to charity
Rarely do people, don't wanna even help at all
'Cause they won't bother buying, getting toys, getting dolls
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
I'ma drummer boy so do, do
I'ma drummer boy so do, do

Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came

Everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs 
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"

My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again

She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you

My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you, above you

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

My heart is blind but I don't care
Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold you near
I never want to let you go, oh

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me the way to your heart
Ooh, my baby, baby, I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle, that's where I'mma start, uh huh

I like how your eyes complementing you hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Our bodies touching while you

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Kissing on your neck while you

Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, okay
Right there, my way
Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it
Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the Benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're trying to snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what'd you choose
You'd choose me, right?

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go


For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Love is in the air
Candles all around us
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change

It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love



Madly in love




Babe, you are the reason to breathe
And babe, you know you're all that I need
Remember when you took my hand
And ran away 
And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes

It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love



Madly in love




I'll make you believe

I heard you're looking for somebody to treat you right
'Cause them other guys don't live up to their height
I heard you're looking for somebody to smack your heart
Cause they going, they shot before you start

You arent got to search no further
I got what you want 
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want 
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe


Believe, believe, believe 

Believe, believe, believe 

Believe, believe, believe 
They can make you promises, but I
I'll make you believe



I heard youre looking for somebody to take control
Baby, give me the green light and we'll go
So let me love you, 'till my heart stops
Let me touch you, when the beat drops
Right there

You arent got to search no further
I got what you want 
I'm not trying to waste your time by telling you what you want 
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe


Believe, believe, believe 

Believe, believe, believe 

Believe, believe, believe 
They can make you promises but I
I'll make you believe

Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do, if I do

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

So I turn around and headed to the old run down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper class men drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
 + 

Never get mad enough to walk out
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon

Denied he fathered a child
There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines

To set the record straight, none of it is true

Do you know this woman?

Never met the woman, so

No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Life in the fast lane as they say

She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', oh, she was wrong

Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didnt give it to her, I'm talking to you

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines
On TV making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didnt give it to her, I'm talking to you

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When I ain't never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You do this, you prove this
Your foolness, seduces

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words
Snippet

Bad chick she getting naughty
My group is at the , tell your friend I'm sorry
We pull up to the club and then we start to party
Last time I was in the Bentley
This time I brought out Rarri
Have a hundred by my neck
I'm still the old me
Yeah I heard them niggas talkin'
And they don't know me
She said she ain't been here before
But she gon' see
I get the poppin of the bed she just owe me

I said meet me at the club, tonight
All them bottles on me
You can meet me at the club, tonight
And you can stand in front of me
I said meet me at the club

We could go slow-ow
Nobody would know-ow
Take it to our section baby
We could make a show-ow yeah
Grab a hand,  let's go

And 'bout that time 
Is 'bout that time we go

I said meet me at the club, tonight
All them bottles on me
You can meet me at the club, tonight
And you can stand in front of me
I said meet me at the club

I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday
But I cant stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe
With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Ay love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ay love, don't you buy me nothing
Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
Thats a merry merry Christmas

Its the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe
I dont wanna miss out on the holiday
But I cant stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

Girl
My love is really strong
I can't ever really be wrong
That's a message I receive directly from God
You ain't that naive
Maybe I'll find you in Spain with your wad
For that's where my dick it is you crave

We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm hording here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as the one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love

What may seem as redundant spasms
Are actually multiple orgasms
You make me touch ecstasy, pleasure's crest
A jolt passes down my spine when my hand is on your supple breast
You always are stubborn, looking for ways to elude
But girl I'll snap my fingers and set you in the mood
I maybe rough, sometimes hard and crass
But baby its heaven when i hold that fine ass
Its an explosion of lust, love and emotions all in a boom
Baby, we made epic love in that hotel room
You call me vampire, hard, cold and pretty
I'm a different breed of monster in flesh, blood..m gritty
Thank god the room service didn't get the pen
Or else they would have heard a loud n horny Edward Cullen
We laughed and joked and the cam went click click
But baby doll its a different joy altogether when our bodies writhed like sweet music
You have no anger
You have no hate
You love the soul and not the money
Blessed I am to be gifted with a piece of paradise, that you honey
You made your way into my heart
My soul you did maraud
Baby Girl I love it when you laugh, your heart pauses and says ohhh gaawwwdd...!!!
Youre my love; youre my life, my essence of life, in the love vortex i finally did fall
My darling, my angel, my sweetheart, my maiden, you will always be my porkydoll
And I will be your satan

We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm hording here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as a one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love

They can't get what they are truly after, cause it's not you
You are my concern
We will genuinely go solid, he'll be too busy to focus on you
There are games I created to get to penetrate you
But it was my greed and selfishness, I hadn't a clue
My pursuit of you doesn't change in this manhood
I was broke at the time
You told me Marshall make something out of your brokenness now, so I wrote this for you
But you don't want to read, that was the last thing on your mind too lou
I'm not a comedian to just witter and not say a thing that I wouldn't mean, with every I mean, I mean
I'm doing my best to get my life together so you find someone serious to settle with
I'll get a clap for every time I crack a joke
But then too their will be serious glares for there ain't no shitty jokes with you
All those three things are in a sync so I'll sync in with the one who doesn't want to make you into a woebegone
It was all madness, it got me waddling off for macaroons
I won't vulgarize this, it's like sugar on vanilla, it's amorous
My animus is vaporized
I'm answerable to no one, it's being in supremo command
I might have bit my tongue, but there is no suppressing thing for you
I'll open up and shout it out, get wild, maybe hurt myself too
It's a bruise, not a Bruce, a Bruce wouldn't let that happen too
I'd re-hydrate and keep saying all that happens till I die for you
Call it magical when I'm with you, till then it's nothing but how wieners maim
Check your calender for tuesdays, Mardi gras is around the corner you might want to lurk in
You think you want to look marred and out, I can see they have surrounded you, climbing you on a pyre right there to burn you
I'll take my boat to a marina and bring some water to put it out
Relax, there ain't no fire, it's the fire within you
It's burning so fast that you can't even think about your stomach too
It's so painful to see you without any loving

We want the same thing, baby
We basically think the same
How could I ever be taken seriously?
With me wandering into your brain
I hear you want to know if you are the one?
Is that a question?
Only one simple thing is true
I can draw straight line between the two of you
That's you, I'm hording here
Living with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer
As far as your question goes
There ain't no such thing as a one
It's one world, one life
We solemnly love

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand that it's meant to be
Cause baby, when you're with me

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?
There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so

Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl, I'm here
If you didn't know, this is love

Let the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go

So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here, right here 
Don't shed a tear
Whenever you need me, I'll be here 
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go
Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you go

Never say never
Yeah, never ever ever ever ever

Yeah, yeah never ever ever ever ever

See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say it, never never say it

I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

Cause there's just no turning back 
When your heart's under attack 
Gonna give everything I have
Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never

Here we go, Guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water in his blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Say never
I will never say never 
Say never
I will fight to forever to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one


They just wanna play with me, they just wanna play with me
Just got back from the Middle East
Maybe just a little cheese, still wanna play with me?
Back to the crib for two minutes, I got something to do
Yeah, you get it
Yeah I copped something new, a new get-up
Yeah, phone coming through, you keep your head up
Gotta have all the new kicks, better have all the new tricks
And my bank go shit, gotta have all the new whips
Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick
I never had a problem with a money clip
Paper always glazed like a honey dip
I was always raised like "Honey, quit"
I'm just being funny with this funny ish

I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one


You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you aint got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

Don't rush , no pressure

Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure

It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty 

I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah
]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you


It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
Its amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you


Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know theres no one, I can relate to
And know we wont find a love thats so true

Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together

I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together
Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
Theres nothing like us, theres nothing like you and me
Together

Take my hand and put it on your chest cause I need your, your love
Yeah would you come right here and do it, baby?
Cause I need you to do it, baby
Your love is keeping me warm, warm, warm

You been gone far away, I just need to hold you babe
Can't believe I'm with you cause you got me open, baby
I'm loving everything you do, I'm thankful that I'm here with you
You make me wanna say

Oh girl, your body is so insane, you're making me call your name, girl
Oh girl, yeah it's like a rush every single time we touch, girl
Oh girl, your body is so insane, you're making me call your name
Oh girl, yeah it's like a rush every single time we touch

Oh girl, your body is so insane, you're making me call your name, girl
Oh girl, I just need to hold you tight
Oh girl, cause you're all mine

Let me start off with the old school flow

Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordan and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda
To know that I'm the ruler a
And I'm, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris Bueller

Cario, me gusta tu estilo

Mis labios en tu cuello
No estamos tan cerca ahora
Nunca como t y yo
No s tu nombre
Pero estoy seguro que me conoces
Un poco de vida con la msica
El sentimiento es mutuo
Me encanta la forma en la que te mueves sobre mi
La piel tan suave, las manos en mi cara para ser dirigidas
Y t eres todo lo que puedo ver
T eres la mejor posicionada por su dinero
Y cuando est cancin suena, ya sabes

Necesito un baile
1942 en mi mano
Una vez ms antes de que me vaya
Tu cuerpo me bloquea, me atas
Necesito un baile
1942 en mi mano
Una vez ms antes de que me vaya
Tu cuerpo me bloquea, me atas

Sabes que me gusta volverme loco
As que ven aqu ahora mismo
Solo tenemos un poco de tiempo
Piensa en voz alta
Celebra la vida conmigo, cario
No tengas prisa en irte

Necesito un baile
1942 en mi mano
Una vez ms antes de que me vaya
Tu cuerpo me bloquea, me atas
Necesito un baile
1942 en mi mano
Una vez ms antes de que me vaya
Tu cuerpo me bloquea, me atas

Agarrate a mi
Un baile ms es todo lo que necesito
Un baile ms es todo lo que necesito

Baby, I like your style

Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know

I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh girl

I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

Hold on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, oh

Justin Bieber
Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses
Wait...I'm not done

I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that "It's not mine"
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me
How I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite, knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner cause some of my dinner
Is still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference and it's starting today

Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me
How I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

Pray for the broken hearted, I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing, I pray for all the souls in need
I pray, can you give 'em one today?
I just can't sleep tonight, can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
I pray, I pray, I pray
I close my eyes and pray, pray


Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything
]
I dont know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that its wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We werent necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You cant be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand thats not who you are. You know youre trying to be the best you can be, but thats all you can do. If you dont give it all you got, youre only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
Thats what happening with me, its like God, Im giving it all Ive got, sometimes Im weak and Im going to do it. And its like Im not giving myself grace, Im just like understanding thats how it is

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought Id see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it dont pay to lie cause I dont wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought Id see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I dont wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought Id see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right

Ride, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride

When I wake up, I first think of you
I really like you and I hope you like me too

Visual, visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened I was floating, you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dining in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, patent leather
Playing the field, trying to outslick Baretta

You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool, tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, trying suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stunting in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rocking like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's something that caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumping to Cash Rules
No question we the reason why the summer's blazing
Then say, "You looking good fly colored Asian"
Raw I give it to you, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
Until she caught me getting numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love, sweet love of mine


Why can't I find you, love of mine?
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?

Leave it up to the most high, sitting in a ghost fly
Chilling with two of my brothers
We both live on deck grabbing 'em on set
This is how we roll in the business, she a go I'mma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month baby girl, just call me up
Waking up resting in cold sweats
Thinking of this bitch, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm going crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady left my homies it's all baloney
Just like rocking the old Pony's
So when I'm chilling, I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that feel me
Take your time, readjust and ya you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

Things seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear  was

Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do

Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat

Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I

there's a little hope for you and

Holy infant so tender and mild

Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at thy birth

She dances in these sheets at night, she dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn and quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long, the kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm, a slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

She dances for the men at work, who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says "Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove, dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late, she must be out her mind


She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just won't appreciate
And though she takes, her love in vain
Though she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out, she swore she'd dance no more
But then she did, he did not quit ans she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life, she danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride, she knew she was needed back home, home

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time, someday at Christmas time


You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me

Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Se que todo fue mi culpa y te cause dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aqu extrandote
Okay, tu por mi morias ma'
No solo fsica, haba qumica
Yo te llamaba y no querias contestar
Se que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no paso de repente
Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte

Solo espero que me perdones
Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tu y yo no podemos estar
Olvida todo, no voy a fallar

This the Rock City, Justin Bieber remix to Sorry

You ain't been answering the phone
And I know you seeing me calling
You say it's over, we're done
Tired of giving me warning
Girls sliding in my DMs
Me said there no time to meet them
Telling you that we just friends
But flying them out on the weekend

I got a weakness for sweetness and everyone knows
I'm going crazy for ladies who dress in tight clothes
I know you're tired of hearing me apologize
And I can see that you're ready to tell me goodbye

For you to just knock on the door
Tell me you want me cause I want you more
Girl, you be tripping, you're too insecure
Dem other girl way too bad to ignore
But me only looking at what's in them stores

There's no sophistication in my lack of patience
I'm just wishing you were better at communication
As I sit here steady waiting
Wishing that you would call my name in
 & Justin Bieber]

It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me

Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong

What should I do? Should I go?
Who do I talk to? Nobody knows
Who knows the answer to all of my questions?
When will I get over this, over this?
 & Justin Bieber]

It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all that love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me

Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change

Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong

With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know

I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!

Said you're amazing
She said you must be crazy
I said "no I'm not, well, a little maybe"
And I don't talk a lot
But when I do I mean it
And I swear I know an angel
Baby when I see you
I know I do have issues
But ain't got to do with you
Not gonna lie girl I miss you
No it ain't superficial
We spent beautiful moments
And some beautiful dream
But ain't nothing more beautiful
Than you were next to me
And I got a couple things

You could be my supermodel
You could be my supermodel

Oh, the way you strut your shit

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose, yeah
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase, oh woah
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah yeah
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas yeah, Merry Christmas oh no, Merry Christmas to you

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

So where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm

And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying
Oh lord

Need you the most
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I stayed by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Need you the most

I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken
Yes I did
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping
Can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping
Tell me...

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
I need you the most

JB, Jaden Smith, let's go

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes dont shed tears, girl, they bawl

Got me thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

I be thinking 'bout you, and you know I do
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl, so are you
Man I heard some things but I don't know what's true
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you, but a man will show it
That's why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause less than months go by, you be dancing away
But let's just have some fun girl, as long as you're here
Cause when you get up on that plane, you'll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment, it's wrong to be scared
Girl is it wrong to be scared? Cause that's what they say
And everyday that I don't see you, you slipping away
And all the teachers in my class thinking I'm crazy
But they don't know that I think about you daily cause I be

Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

Baby I could pick you up in the Rolls Royce
Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
Every time that I'm away, girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that'll never stop
They say it's true love, well is love true?
Yeah I think it's love, that's why I found you
And not a second that goes by that I don't think you are so fly
And I know why ain't no guy gon' treat you like I
Wanna, gonna be the man that treats you right, be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right, let's go into the night

Thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you, oh no no no
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh
Do you not think so far ahead?
Cause I been thinking about forever, ooh

Babe, you are the reason to breathe, babe

Girl, I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you love me
We let it stray for a while, yeah
Looks so deceiving, you convinced me, yeah

So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
Not the things you do, but the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Love with the thought of you

I fell victim to your style
It's so amazing, girl, you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Then tryna be without you girl, girl, girl, girl

So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time, but I'll figure it out
Why should we fight the feeling?

Though it's infatuation

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah

Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah

To keep a roof above our heads,
You chose, a life for me, no never gave up, I admire you, For the strength youve instilled in me,
You were so young, You were just my age, when you had me mom, You were so brave. There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you will always be there for me

It was 94, the year that everything started to change, from before, You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not
Ignore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart
So when youre lost and youre tired
When youre broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you

Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you ain't really knew

You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back

And you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody
You got it bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ho, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm, I'm taken by the thought of this

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

Baby, we can go nowhere but up

As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

It's a big big world, and I'm gonna show you all of it

Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda

Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor

Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hating on the Internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets no service, we at the top working
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili
You know me, I'm just tryna...
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!


Open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away, 
Oh, wash away

21 years ago, it's never ever been the same
And all my life I never wanted to play the game
I'm not the same as Michael even though the hall of fame
I'm all hall of faith
Put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things I learned along the way
Figured out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me...

Open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away, 
Oh, wash away

Happy birthday

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They aint never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They aint ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary 
Don't want us to lose what we are

Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

She texts me "How's you love life?"
And "How are you?", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco

You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are

Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

Look at all the choices, the choices in this world
World spreading no freedom, freedom for the boys and the girls
But the boys and the girls they dont know, what love is like
Love is like appreciation mixed in a double cup of Sprite

So can we go?
No left or right
You go your way
And I'll go mine

Cause this is my time
And I wont waste it
Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay

Look at all the places, places that I've been
It doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength
And when it goes down and its all said and done
You gotta stand up so theres no need to run

And now that I've made it
I wont look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did


Look at all the people standing outside
So dedicated
Your love doesn't go unrecognised
Your love doesn't go unrecognised


What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Youre so indecisive, what Im saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then youre down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes

Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

Youre overprotective when Im leaving
Trying to compromise but I cant win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then youre down and then between
Oh, I really want to know

What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes

You keep playin games with me that's not coasta
Instead of blessin me now like you supposed ta
You take me aboard love roller coasta
Trying to get off when your on like Oprah girl
That's a negative
Like a pessimist
You say it ain't love
I say yes it is
Well I'm guessing this
The big question is
Why you sending me all these mixed messages

Where are you now when I need you the most?
Why don't you take my hand?
I want to be close
Help me when I am down, lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Where are you now?

Where are you now now that I'm half grown?
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone
Where are you now when nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

I need you to need me
Can't you see me?
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me, hold me, and love me now
Where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Oh, where are you now?

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah
{{O es-tu maintenant}}
Uhhohhh yeah
O es-tu maintenant
Quand jai le plus besoin de toi
Pourquoi ne prends-tu pas ma main, Je veux tre proche de
Toi
Prends ma main et marche avec moi
Refrain :
O es-tu maintenant
Quand rien ne va plus
O es-tu maintenant
Je ne peux pas voir la lumire
Alors prends ma main et marche avec moi
Montre moi quoi tre
Jai besoin dtre libre
O es-tu maintenant
Maintenant que jai grandi
Pourquoi sommes nous spar et loign
Je me sens seul
Refrain :
O es-tu maintenant
Quand rien ne va plus
O es-tu maintenant
Je ne peux pas voir la lumire
Running everywhere trying to find who I am
Going nowhere so I'm trying again
I am so lost like paper no pen
Yes you have call so, yes, here I am
Cold no sweater
Bold no letter
So much better
My role go-getter
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes
I'mma rain no weather
The goal I'mma set is a whole lot better
When the storm from Jehovah comes
I'm gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart
I'mma roll ah were never be apart
But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder?
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter
Yeah, a straight gunner, but it feels strange
Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute?
Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
Life is so short, but we just take it for granted
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
Flying so high and, yes, I just landed
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
I'm growing up quick like a grown man is
I'mma be set so will my great grand kids
Swag!!!!!

I'm doing better without you, you, you, you
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you
Thought I was tripping without you, you, you, you

I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
No
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
Yeah

Yeah, I think they mad 'cause I'm driving in the fast lane
But I've been grindin' for years, ask hype game
It's funny how stuff doesn't change
From sleepin' in the car to coppin' me that Range
I'm all world star
All them other blogs
All them haters hatin' 'cause I am a heartthrob
But do I want it all?
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me
I'm here to make history
I'm speakin' it real
Backtrack to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah
So I'ma show the world that I'm ill
Every beat that I get on best believe I'ma kill
So you can have all the jewelry
Have all the cars
Have all the fame
Have all the broads
You can have the fact that I'm a star
Just so you can listen to these bars

I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
No
I, I see them coming, coming
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
No

Yeah, they talk
Yeah, they talk
They don't walk the walk I walk
I won't stop, 'til I drop
Until then, I reach the top
I'ma rock to where I need to be
Walk the path of destiny
Definitely been neglected
But God is always testin' me
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be
A lot of men ain't different though
Just let it be
Set it free
Never be scared to make change, effectively
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively
Every person in this world can do good
I just want this message understood
Alright, stop
Everybody's gotta listen
Make the decision to envision
A better place with no division
Religion
Everybody needs a mission
Haters need to stop it, just listen

I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
No

I, I see them coming, coming
I see them coming, yeah
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop 
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop 
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop 
No

I want a hot night with a thousand things to do
I am not in Pop Culture
Over the Bitch of Pop
A warm night, a crazy dream
Give me your body 
You know what I want 
The weather was a detail
His touch and kisses
My mind was simple
I want to collapse
Even if it's with you
The Beautiful was the soul
And it became just you 
Give me one night of love 
I want it to float, like music in the air
I want is his body in half measures will abuse
You talk I obey, not only want fame
I want success, united, pop and power

Move me for sex, hot night 
I want to collapse
A night of pleasure just me and you
Want it now 
I want that moment 
You are my drug 
My way to lose 
I want you 
I want to be happy and crazy
You're my addiction
Fame, success, spotlight is my power
You are my drug, and sex will drive me mad
I'm not a kid anymore, I own the Moment Bitch
Reaches the end, I want to be with you
Give me what I want, you want me
Suffice to say, leave me without action
Make me crazy
Of what I want 
I want you

Verse: 
Baby it's AcE come over to my place maybe we could stay|
Take you to the moon and beyond you remember that other dude you were with and now he's gone, it's not your fault he ain't answer the phone|
You deserve better and you deserve more, take you to the new world and down to the core no wonder you were bored|
I wish I had the money to buy you diamonds and gold even if it was little like someone's "OH" Haha ok hold|
We could up in flight take the route to the sky never make you cry like when he said bye-bye|
Girl you know you want me and you know you hate him c'mon girl quit playing|
You want me bad even though he's just sad, oh man you look mad|
Am I hurting your feelings well I hope I did, you said you would get me bro don't KiD|
Go ahead sit there throw a fit if only you were to take my advice a bit|
