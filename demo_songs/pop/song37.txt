living like a contradd sead
poor baby, do you like you around take the truck up, how that toda't funt him at night

'cause something way too "honey, all shame on meant to be
i don't mean to listen to the radio

blazing out one night train to memphss
you love that someone we arent that love can make your memories lighting
