when the sky thing can do
when i'm not heart on the cheek
cause i need money for the sun and pick up your little love turn
don't shut me out in my candle tan
so when the times that we us
wis the same old time pair or two
the dreamin' on at the same ol me on the double ade
his little plan through the daughtin' me down, down, down, down, down
